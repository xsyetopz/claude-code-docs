// Adapter for the surfaces that have no zod schema in the program: status line input, transcript lines,
// OpenTelemetry, frontmatter, and ~/.claude.json. It reads the program's code (the object literals and key
// lists that build each payload) and writes one JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) per surface to schemas/.
// Anchors are literal key names and strings, never minified identifiers; each file's $comment names them.
//
//   bun tools/schemas/code.ts [--bin <binary>] [--captures <dir>] [--out <dir>] [--check] [--spreads]
//
// --spreads lists each spread the adapter cannot resolve, with its module and the index of its literal.
//
// Conventions in the output: a field's type is the type the code gives it (a literal, or a computed value
// followed through names, calls, members, and built-ins such as String() or .length). A field whose type
// the code does not show is `{}` with "x-unverified": true.
// A field that a probe in captures/<version>/ saw is marked "x-observed": true.
// A field still "x-unverified" gets "x-observed-type": [...] when tools/schemas/observed/ has enough samples
// of real payloads (see observed.ts). The type is not enforced; "x-unverified" keeps its meaning.
// A field typed by hand in tools/schemas/manual/ (see manual.ts) gets that type and loses "x-unverified".
