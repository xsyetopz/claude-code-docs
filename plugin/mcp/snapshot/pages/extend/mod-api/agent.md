# Agent


`$.agent` starts and lists subagents and teammates, and it registers new agent types.
`agent.offer` decides which agent types the model sees.
`agent.spawn` picks the model of a new agent or refuses it.

## At a Glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Can you use it? | ✅ Yes. `const { agentId } = await $.agent.spawn({ prompt: "Read README.md." })` |
| Can you change it? | ✅ Yes. Hook `agent.spawn` to pick a model or refuse. Hook `agent.offer` to hide a type. |
| Can you turn it on or off? | Return `{ isOffered: false }` or `{ deny }` from a hook. |
| Where does it live? | The hooks module of a plugin. |
| Status | [Documented] |

In a "Where it can be used" cell, "Run time" means in a hook, in a closure that a hook drew, or in a timer callback. It does not mean inside `register`.

## Example

This hook sends every subagent that does not name a model to `haiku`.

```javascript
on('agent.spawn', async ($, e, next) => next(e.model ? e : { ...e, model: 'haiku' }))
```

## Members of the Agent Noun

| Item | Status | What it does | How it works | Where it can be used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$.agent.spawn` | [Documented] | Spawns a subagent. It is the event `agent.spawn`, the same call the engine makes when the Agent tool starts one. | `(input: AgentSpawnArgs) => Promise<AgentSpawnResult>`. Starts a subagent in the background and resolves `{ model, agentId }` or `{ deny }`. | Run time. |
| `$.agent.list` | [Documented] | Returns the agents of the session so far, subagents and teammates, whoever spawned them. | `() => Promise<AgentInfo[]>`. One entry for each agent until the engine drops its task. A workflow's agents are not listed. | Run time. |
| `$.agent.register` | [Documented] | Defines an agent type, named `<plugin>:<name>`, that the Agent tool dispatches from the next turn on. | `(spec: AgentSpec) => Promise<...>`. Takes the same fields as an agent file. A second call with the same name replaces the first. Rejects on an invalid spec. | After the session binds at `session.start` (rejects before). |

## Engine Events

| Item | Status | What it does | How it works | Where it can be used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent.offer` | [Documented] | Fires when the engine offers an agent type to the model, in the agent listing and again at dispatch. `next(e)` resolves to `{ isOffered: true }`. | Input `AgentOfferInput`. Result `AgentOfferResult`. Return `{ isOffered: false }` to hide the type from the model and refuse its dispatch. | `on('agent.offer', ...)`. In tests: `$.agent.offer(...)` on the test engine (not on a hook's `$`). |
| `agent.spawn` | [Documented] | Fires when the Agent tool, or a workflow script's `agent()` call, is about to start an agent, before the model is resolved. | Input `AgentSpawnInput`. Result `AgentSpawnResult`: `{ model }` or `{ deny }`. A guard that fails is skipped and the subagent starts. | `on('agent.spawn', ...)`. Also `$.agent.spawn(...)`. |

## Events Raised by Agent Calls

| Item | Status | What it does | How it works | Where it can be used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent.list` | [Documented] | The argument of `$.agent.list()`. | Input `NoArgs`. Value `AgentInfo[]`. A hook above the caller returns `next(e)`, `{ deny: reason }`, or `{ value }`. | `on('agent.list', ...)` |
| `agent.register` | [Documented] | The argument of `$.agent.register(spec)`. A hook above can rewrite any of it, but the type stays the caller's. | Input `AgentSpec`. Value `{ agent: string }`. | `on('agent.register', ...)` |

## Agent Types

### Call Records and Status

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentCallRecord` | [Documented] | What an Agent call raised by a plugin (`$.tool.call({ tool: "Agent", ... })`) answers as `result` once the agent settles. `text` is its final answer. | Fields `agentId` (as `$.agent.list()` names it) and `resolvedModel?`. A plugin's spawn always runs in the background. |
| `AgentStatus` | [Documented] | Where an agent's loop stands. | `'pending' \| 'running' \| 'waiting' \| 'idle' \| 'completed' \| 'failed' \| 'killed'`. `idle` means between turns until a message wakes it. A message may resume an ended agent under the same id. |
| `AgentLoop` | [Documented] | Which model loop an event happened in. | Field `agentId?`: the loop's agent id inside a subagent or teammate, absent on the main loop. Pinned. `next.origin` names the plugin that caused the call. |
| `AgentTeammateRecord` | [Documented] | What an Agent call that started a teammate answers as `result`. | `status` (`'teammate_spawned'`), `agentId?`, `agent_id` (older spelling), `teammate_id`, `name` (any `@` replaced, with a suffix such as `scout-2` when taken), `team_name?`, `agent_type?`, `resolvedModel?`, `model?`, `prompt`. |

### What `$.agent.list()` Returns

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentInfo.id` | [Documented] | The agent's one id. | `string`. The Agent tool calls it `agentId`. The classic events call it `agent_id`. A teammate in its own terminal pane uses its address as the id. |
| `AgentInfo.teammateId` | [Documented] | A teammate's address in its team, `<name>@<team>`. | `string`, optional. Absent for other agents. |
| `AgentInfo.description` | [Documented] | The Agent call's short `description` of the task. | `string`. |
| `AgentInfo.type` | [Documented] | The agent type it was spawned as (`general-purpose`, `Explore`), or `teammate`. | `string`. |
| `AgentInfo.status` | [Documented] | Where its loop stands now. | `AgentStatus`. |
| `AgentInfo.parentId` | [Documented] | The id of the agent whose loop spawned it. | `string`, optional. Absent when the main loop did. |
| `AgentInfo.spawnedBy` | [Documented] | The plugin whose `$.agent.spawn` (or Agent `$.tool.call`) started it. | `string`, optional. Absent when the model or the person did. |
| `AgentInfo.name` | [Documented] | What SendMessage addresses it by, when it has one. | `string`, optional. Two agents may hold one name. `id` tells them apart. |

### Offer Types

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentOfferInput.agent` | [Documented] | Which type (`Explore`, `Plan`, a plugin's agent). It is the key a matcher narrows on. | `string`. |
| `AgentOfferInput.description` | [Documented] | The text of its listing line (`whenToUse`). | `string`. |
| `AgentOfferInput.source` | [Documented] | Where the definition came from (`built-in`, `plugin`, a settings source). | `string`. |
| `AgentOfferInput.provider` | [Documented] | Who provides this agent: the plugin and its tier. A built-in is `{ plugin: "engine", tier: "core" }`. | `Origin`. Pinned. |
| `AgentOfferResult.isOffered` | [Documented] | Whether the model is offered the type, in its listing and at dispatch. | `boolean`. |

### Spawn Types

`AgentSpawnArgs` is the input of the call: the `prompt` field of `AgentSpawnInput` plus optional `description`, `subagentType`, `model`, `name`, and `cwd`.
A hook may rewrite the content keys of `AgentSpawnInput`. Every other key is pinned.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentSpawnInput.tool_use_id` | [Documented] | The Agent tool call this spawn belongs to. Pinned. | `string`. For a workflow agent it is the Workflow tool call that started the run. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.prompt` | [Documented] | The task the subagent gets. A rewrite is the prompt it runs with. | `string`. On a workflow run that hides its script, it is a placeholder, and a rewrite is not applied. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.description` | [Documented] | The short description of the task. A rewrite is what the task shows as. | `string`. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.subagentType` | [Documented] | The resolved agent type (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, a plugin's agent, `fork`). | `string`. A name that matches no agent refuses the spawn. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.provider` | [Documented] | Who provides this agent. Pinned. | `Origin`. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.model` | [Documented] | The Agent tool's `model` parameter as given, an alias (`haiku`) or a full id. | `string`, optional. A hook sets it to pick the model. Forks inherit the model, so it is ignored for them. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.parentModel` | [Documented] | The parent's effective model, what `inherit` resolves to. Pinned. | `string`. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.parentAgentId` | [Documented] | The id of the loop the spawn happens in. Pinned. | `string`, optional. Absent from main. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.permissionMode` | [Documented] | The parent's permission mode, which the subagent inherits. Pinned. | `string`, optional. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.background` | [Documented] | True when the subagent runs in the background or remotely. | `boolean`. The agent definition or remote isolation can force it on. Disabled background tasks force it off. A teammate's is always true. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.fork` | [Documented] | True for a fork of the parent. It inherits the parent's context and model. Pinned. | `boolean`. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.isTeammate` | [Documented] | Present and true when the call starts a teammate. Pinned. | `true`, optional. A teammate is a named agent of the session's team. It goes idle between turns and wakes on a message. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.workflow` | [Documented] | Present when a workflow script's `agent()` starts the agent. Pinned. | `object`, optional. A hook may rewrite `prompt` and `model` only. A deny becomes the error that the script's `agent()` throws. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.resume` | [Documented] | Present when the run resumes a subagent or brings a teammate back from disk. | `object`, optional. A hook can only refuse it. A deny leaves the agent parked. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.name` | [Documented] | The name given by the call, which SendMessage can address. Pinned. | `string`, optional. A teammate whose name the team already has gets a suffix. |
| `AgentSpawnInput.cwd` | [Documented] | The directory the subagent runs in, when the call set one. A rewrite is where it runs. | `string`, optional. A teammate runs in the session's directory. |
| `AgentSpawnResult.model` | [Documented] | What the subagent runs on. | `string`. From core it is the resolved id. From a hook it can be an alias or an id. |
| `AgentSpawnResult.agentId` | [Documented] | The id of the started subagent. | `string`, optional. Set by core. A hook that answers without `next` started none. |
| `AgentSpawnResult.teammateId` | [Documented] | A started teammate's address, `<name>@<team>`. | `string`, optional. Set by core. |
| `AgentSpawnResult.deny` | [Documented] | Refuses the spawn, so nothing starts. | `string`. The text is the Agent tool's error, or the error a workflow's `agent()` call throws. Returned after `next(e)` was answered, it fails the hook. |

`AgentSpawnResult` is either `{ model, agentId, teammateId? }` or `{ deny }`. The answer of the subagent comes in its own `turn.complete` with this `agentId`.

### Agent Spec

`AgentSpec` is what `$.agent.register` takes. It is an agent definition as spelled in settings JSON, plus a `name`. It accepts every field that an agent file or a `--agents` entry accepts.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentSpec.name` | [Documented] | The short name of the type. The type is `<plugin>:<name>`. | `string`. Letters, digits, `_`, `-`, up to 64. |
| `AgentSpec.description` | [Documented] | When to delegate to this agent. The model reads it in its listing, and `agent.offer` gets it. | `string`. |
| `AgentSpec.prompt` | [Documented] | The agent's system prompt, whole. It replaces the session's. | `string`. |
| `AgentSpec.tools` | [Documented] | What the agent may call, by tool name (`Read`, `Bash`, `mcp__x__y`). A call to any other is refused. Left out means every tool of the parent. | `readonly string[]`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.disallowedTools` | [Documented] | Tools withheld from the agent, out of whatever `tools` allows. | `readonly string[]`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.model` | [Documented] | The agent's model: an alias (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`), a full id, or `inherit`. Left out means the session's subagent default. | `string`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.effort` | [Documented] | The agent's effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or an integer budget. | `string \| number`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.permissionMode` | [Documented] | How the agent's permission asks are decided: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `auto`, `dontAsk`, or `bypassPermissions`. Left out means the parent's. | `string`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.mcpServers` | [Documented] | Servers connected over MCP for the agent's run: a configured server's name, or one server's config inline. | `readonly (string \| Record<string, unknown>)[]`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.hooks` | [Documented] | Settings hooks in force while the agent runs, in the `hooks` shape of `settings.json`. | `Record<string, unknown>`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.maxTurns` | [Documented] | The most turns the agent takes before it stops. | `number`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.autoCompactWindow` | [Documented] | Token count, 100000 to 1000000, at which the agent compacts its own conversation. It only lowers the window. | `number`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.skills` | [Documented] | Skill names preloaded into the agent's context before its first turn. | `readonly string[]`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.initialPrompt` | [Documented] | The agent's first user turn. `{{intent}}` in it takes the spawn's prompt. Left out means the spawn's prompt is the first turn. | `string`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.memory` | [Documented] | A persistent memory the agent keeps between runs, and where. | `'user' \| 'project' \| 'local'`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.background` | [Documented] | Every spawn of the agent runs in the background. | `true`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.omitClaudeMd` | [Documented] | The agent's context carries no CLAUDE.md block. | `true`, optional. |
| `AgentSpec.isolation` | [Documented] | Where the agent runs apart from the session: `worktree` (its own git worktree) or `remote` (a cloud session where the build allows one). | `'worktree' \| 'remote'`, optional. |
