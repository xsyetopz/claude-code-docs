# Anthropic Docs

The `clawdipedia` source describes what Claude Code 2.1.316 does, checked against the program and not only against the official docs. Use them instead of memory for any detail that the user may act on: a key name, a default, an environment variable, a hook field. Memory of these details is often stale or wrong. The other three sources cover official docs and Claude resources pages.

## Pick the Source

Four sources answer four kinds of question. Choose with the `source` value (default `clawdipedia`).

| Source | Reads | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clawdipedia` | This unofficial site, checked against the program | How Claude Code really works: settings, environment variables, flags, hooks, plugins, internals, JSON Schemas, and undocumented or version-specific behavior. It has the badges. |
| `code` | code.claude.com/docs | What the official Claude Code docs say. Use it to compare with `clawdipedia`, or to cite the official page. |
| `platform` | platform.claude.com/docs | The Claude API, SDKs, models, and prompt caching (not Claude Code itself). |
| `claude-resources` | claude.com/resources | Claude product articles, guides, and webinars: use cases, how-to advice, and product announcements (not Claude Code behavior). |

Only `clawdipedia` has badges and schemas. `get_schema` reads `clawdipedia` only.

## Find the Answer

1. If the tools `search_docs`, `read_page`, `list_pages`, and `get_schema` are available (the `clawdipedia-docs` MCP server; the tool names are `mcp__plugin_clawdipedia-docs_docs__search_docs` and so on), use them:
   - `search_docs` with an exact identifier or short keywords (`PreToolUse timeout`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`), not a whole question. Then `read_page` on the best route. `limit` (1 to 25, default 8) caps the hits, and `section` limits them to a top-level section such as `configure`.
   - `read_page` with `section_heading` (for example `Related Pages`) when a page is long. For a long page, call again with `offset` set to the `offset` in the "more" note.
   - `list_pages` to browse the sections and find routes.
   - `get_schema` for the exact fields of a config file or a payload: `settings`, `managed-settings`, `plugin-manifest`, `plugin-hooks`, `marketplace`, `keybindings`, `mcp`, `agents-json`, `hook-output`, `tools`, `control-protocol`, `stream-json`, `frontmatter`, `status-line`, `transcript`, `otel`, or `claude-json`. Without `property` it gives an outline. Pass `property` to get one key or one definition, such as `BashInput`.
   - `get_schema` with `name: "types"` for the Mod API type file: pass `property` as a type (`ToolCheckResult`), a member (`ToolCheckResult.plugin`), a call (`$.tool.check`), or an event (`tool.check`).
   - Pass `source` to `search_docs`, `read_page`, or `list_pages` to read another source (see "Pick the source"). Pages of `platform`, `code`, and `claude-resources` are not covered by the badges. For `list_pages`, `section` is a top-level section for `clawdipedia` and a group or section name (such as `Messages`) for the others. `claude-resources` pages are converted from HTML; its sections are `articles`, `guides`, `webinars`, and `webinar-series`.
   - Each result ends with a `Source:` line. If it says offline, the text comes from the disk cache and may be old: say so.
2. If the tools are not available, fetch plain text from the `clawdipedia` site (the other sources have no plain-text fallback here; fetch their pages by URL):
   - `https://clawdipedia.cc/llms.txt` is the index with one line per page.
   - Add `.md` to a page URL for its markdown, for example `https://clawdipedia.cc/configure/status-line.md`.
   - `https://clawdipedia.cc/llms-full.txt` holds every page. It is large: fetch it only when you must search across pages.
   - The JSON Schemas and the Mod API type file (`claude-code.d.ts`) live under `https://clawdipedia.cc/schemas/`.

## Read the Badges

Tables have a Status column. State the badge when you report a fact, because it tells the user how far to trust it.

- Documented: an official docs page names the item.
- Undocumented: only the program shows it. It works today and can change without notice, so say so.
- Differs: the official docs and the program disagree. Report what the row says the program does.
- Gated: it works only behind a flag or a server gate. Name the gate.

## Answer

- Say which source the answer comes from. For `clawdipedia`, say which version it is for: Claude Code 2.1.316. If the user runs another version, say the page may not match it.
- Cite the page (its URL) next to each fact.
- Before you name a field of a payload (a `$` call, an event, a hook input or output, a tool input), look it up in the type file or a schema with `get_schema`, and name only the fields you found. When a lookup comes back empty, tell the user the field is unconfirmed for this version and give the closest names the lookup returned.
- If the docs do not cover the question, say so. Do not fill the gap from memory as if it were documented.
