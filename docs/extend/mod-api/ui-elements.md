title: Surfaces, Elements, and Render Sites
description: What a mod may draw and where - the surfaces, the 15 render sites with their props, and the JSX globals.
sidebar_position: 8

An element is a building block of a drawing, such as `Box`, `Text`, or `Button`.
A render site is a part of Claude Code that a mod may redraw, such as the spinner or the prompt hint.
A `ui.render` hook gets the site in `e.component` and returns a tree of elements.
The 15 render sites are `AskUserQuestion`, `UserMessage`, `AssistantMessage`, `ToolUse`, `ToolResult`, `ToolGroup`, `ToolProgress`, `CommandOutput`, `Spinner`, `TurnDuration`, `InfoNotice`, `SessionMode`, `PromptHint`, `AbovePrompt`, and `Pane`.
The engine alone draws the permission dialog. A mod adds context to it with `$.ui.notice`.

Return the engine's tree (call `next(e)`) to leave a site as it is. JSX needs a `.tsx` or `.jsx` file.

Source: the Mod API type file of the 2.1.311 program (`schemas/claude-code.d.ts`).

## Example

This hook adds a tail to the hint line under the prompt.

```javascript
on("ui.render", { component: "PromptHint" }, async ($, e, next) =>
  next({ ...e, props: { ...e.props, tail: " (mod)" } }),
);
```

There are no string tags in JSX.
Every tag is an element from `$.ui.resolve(e)`, and JSX compiles a tag to `h(Box, props, ...children)`.

```tsx
on("ui.render", { component: "Pane" }, async ($, e) => {
  const { Box, Text } = $.ui.resolve(e);
  return (
    <Box>
      <Text>Hello</Text>
    </Box>
  );
});
```

## Surfaces

| Item | Status | What it does | Elements | Where it can be used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `terminal` | <Documented /> | Ink. Draws the whole tree of the hook. | `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Link`, `Code`, `Markdown`, `Client`, `Raster`, `Image`. No `Svg`. | `e.surface === 'terminal'` |
| `desktop` | <Documented /> | Claude Code Desktop. Asks over the wire. | `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Svg`, `Link`, `Code`, `Markdown`, `Client`. | `e.surface === 'desktop'` |
| `mobile` | <Documented /> | The mobile app. Asks over the wire. | `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Svg`, `Link`, `Code`, `Markdown`. No `Input`, `Select`, or `Client` yet. The docs name no mobile surface. | `e.surface === 'mobile'` |
| `vscode` | <Differs note="The type file says no surface is attached yet. The docs say the extension draws from 2.1.299 in a session that fetches feature flags." /> | The editor webview. The same table as `desktop` without `Client`. | `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Svg`, `Link`, `Code`, `Markdown`. | `e.surface === 'vscode'` |

## Render Sites and Props

"Read-only" means a rewrite must carry the prop on as received. A change is refused.
Many sites have `onScreen` (type `OnScreen \| null`, optional, read-only): which of its rows the viewport shows now. It is `null` while drawn outside the viewport, and absent where the surface does not say.

### `AskUserQuestion`

The dialog the AskUserQuestion tool opens. A tree for it holds the engine's node once. At most 12 rows on the terminal and 48 on other surfaces. Markdown works on other surfaces only.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | The name of the tool whose call opened the dialog. | `string`. |
| `questions` | <Documented /> | The tool's `questions` input, as the dialog draws them. A rewrite must still fit the tool's schema, or the original is drawn. | `unknown[]`. |
| `metadataSource` | <Documented /> | The call's `metadata.source` (who asked), when the model gave one. Analytics only, never drawn. | `string`, optional. |

### `UserMessage`

A user-role transcript row: the person's prompt, a background task notification, or a message from another agent, teammate, or session. A rewrite of `text` changes only what is drawn. The stored message stays as it was.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | <Documented /> | What the row shows. | `string`. A rewrite is drawn up to 100000 characters. A teammate block with several frames keeps the engine's drawing. |
| `origin` | <Documented /> | Where the stored message came from, as `prompt.submit` named it: composer, task notification, peer, channel, or plugin. | `PromptOrigin`. Read-only. `unclassified` for a teammate's message and for a message stored before stamps. |
| `isExpanded` | <Documented /> | Whether the view draws the row in full: the ctrl+o transcript, `--verbose`, or a surface with no ctrl+o. | `boolean`. Read-only. When false, a message row is one dim line that names the sender. |
| `task` | <Documented /> | What a notification row (`origin.kind` `task-notification`) reports on: its background task. | `UserMessageTask`, optional. Read-only. |
| `from` | <Documented /> | Who sent the message: another agent of this session, a teammate, another session, or a channel. | `UserMessageFrom`, optional. Read-only. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `AssistantMessage`

One block of an assistant reply: its text, or a summary of the text the model wrote between two tool calls. A rewrite changes the drawing and leaves the stored message alone. It is raised on every attached surface.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The block's text in markdown, as the surface will draw it. | `string`. |
| `isFirstOfReply` | <Documented /> | True on the block that draws the bullet that opens a reply. | `boolean`. |
| `isSummary` | <Documented /> | True on a block that holds a summary of the model's text. | `true`, optional, read-only. A rewrite that changes it is refused. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `ToolUse`

A tool call's row in the transcript, such as `Bash(ls -la)` and its result. The call was decided by `tool.call`, so a rewrite here changes the row alone. Raised on every attached surface.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The id `tool.call` carried for this call. Same value as the row's `requestId`. | `string`. Read-only. |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | Which tool the row draws (`Bash`, `Read`, a plugin's tool). | `string`. |
| `input` | <Documented /> | The call's input, as the model sent it. | `unknown`. |
| `isRunning` | <Documented /> | True while the call is still running. | `boolean`. |
| `isErrored` | <Documented /> | True when the call ended in an error. A refusal at the dialog counts. | `boolean`. |
| `isInterrupted` | <Documented /> | True when an abort ended the call: the user's Esc or a plugin's `$.turn.abort`. | `boolean`. The row draws `Interrupted`. |
| `output` | <Documented /> | The stored result once the call has resolved. Undefined while it runs. | `unknown`, optional. For a failed, refused, or cut call it is the text the model read. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `ToolResult`

The result block under a standalone tool row, which the tool's own result renderer draws from `output`. A rewrite of `output` is checked against the tool's output schema. One that does not fit draws nothing. The stored result is untouched.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The id of the call this result belongs to. | `string`. Read-only. |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | Which tool the result belongs to. | `string`. Read-only. |
| `output` | <Documented /> | The tool's own result object. The same one `ToolUse.output` carries. A rewrite is drawn. | `unknown`. |
| `isErrored` | <Documented /> | True when the call ended in an error. The row then draws the error text, not `output`. | `boolean`. Read-only. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `ToolGroup`

A run of tool calls that the transcript folds into one count line, such as `Read 3 files, ran 2 shell commands`. A hook that sets `isExpanded` unfolds the group. Each unfolded row is a `ToolUse`. The fullscreen ctrl+o view draws no `ToolGroup`.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calls` | <Documented /> | The calls of the group, in the order the model made them. | `ReadonlyArray<ToolGroupCall>`. |
| `isActive` | <Documented /> | True while the group is the live one. A call in it may still run, and the model's next call may join it. | `boolean`. |
| `isExpanded` | <Documented /> | Whether each call draws as its own `ToolUse` row, or the group draws one line. | `boolean`. True under `--verbose` and in the non-fullscreen ctrl+o transcript. The one prop a rewrite changes on screen. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `CommandOutput`

The output row a slash command printed in the transcript, under its echo. A rewrite of `text` changes only what is drawn. The model still reads the stored row.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | <Documented /> | Which command printed the row, as `command.run` named it (no slash). | `string`. Read-only. A change or a drop is refused, and the engine draws its own row. |
| `args` | <Documented /> | The arguments of the run, as the echo shows them. `***` for a command that marks its arguments sensitive. | `string`. Read-only. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The text of the row, in markdown. | `string`. |
| `isErrored` | <Documented /> | True when the row is the error line of a command that threw. | `boolean`. Read-only. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `ToolProgress`

One row of the live tool-progress region under a running tool call. Today it is the run-in-background pill. A hook matches `{ props: { kind: "background_hint" } }`.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The tool call the row belongs to. | `string`. Read-only. While several foreground calls share one pill, the first of them. |
| `kind` | <Documented /> | Which progress row. | `'background_hint'`. Read-only. |
| `hint` | <Documented /> | The text of the pill as the engine draws it, dim. For example `(ctrl+b to run in background)`. | `string`. A rewrite is drawn in its place. `""` draws nothing. |

### Spinner

The line that animates while a turn runs, such as `Sauteing... (12s, 300 tokens)`. On the desktop it is the row that carries the mark of the turn.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `word` | <Documented /> | The animated word (`Sauteing`), as sampled for this turn. | `string`. On the desktop it is what the step is doing (`Creating notes.md`), or `Working`. |
| `message` | <Documented /> | The text drawn instead of the word while a state overrides it. Otherwise null. | `string \| null`. |
| `suffix` | <Documented /> | What the engine draws after the word to say the turn is still going: one ellipsis character. | `string`. Not added to a text that already ends in an ellipsis. |
| `mode` | <Documented /> | What the turn is doing. | `'requesting' \| 'responding' \| 'thinking' \| 'tool-input' \| 'tool-use'`. The desktop never says `tool-input`. |

### `TurnDuration`

The line that closes a turn in the transcript, such as `Baked for 3s`. Only the terminal surface raises it. A remote surface draws its own footer.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `word` | <Documented /> | The past-tense word the line drew (`Baked`). | `string`. |
| `durationMs` | <Documented /> | The duration of the turn in milliseconds. | `number`. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `InfoNotice`

One dim status line under the logo (the model source, an experiment enrollment, a settings hint), with a trailing `/command`. Terminal only.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The text of the notice, flattened to one string. | `string`. |
| `command` | <Documented /> | The slash command appended after the text. | `string \| null`. |
| `onScreen` | <Documented /> | Which rows are in the viewport. | See above. |

### `SessionMode`

The dim mode labels at the right of the prompt footer (`focus`, `memory paused`), joined by `&`. One instance. Terminal and desktop only. A hook adds a mode by rewriting `modes`, removes one by filtering, or draws its own tree.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `modes` | <Documented /> | The labels the footer shows, in order. Empty when there are none. | `readonly string[]`. |

### `PromptHint`

The dim hint line under the prompt (`? for shortcuts`, `esc to interrupt`, and the pills beside them). One instance.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isDraft` | <Documented /> | True while the prompt holds typed text. | `boolean`. Read-only. |
| `isWorking` | <Documented /> | True while a model turn is running. | `boolean`. Read-only. |
| `hint` | <Documented /> | The text of the line as the engine draws it, one string. A rewrite replaces the line. | `string`. |
| `tail` | <Documented /> | Text a hook adds after the line. | `string`, optional. The terminal draws it dim. It is left out when fewer than four columns would show. |

### `AbovePrompt`

The band directly above the prompt input, where surveys draw. The engine draws a `[-]` beside the tree and an `n more` row under it. A hook draws one tree or passes. The person collapses it (ctrl+x ctrl+a) or focuses it (a click, ctrl+x tab).

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hasSurvey` | <Documented /> | True while a survey holds the band. A hook yields to it. | `boolean`. Read-only. |
| `isWorking` | <Documented /> | True while a model turn is running. | `boolean`. Read-only. |
| `maxRows` | <Documented /> | Rows the band may take. In fullscreen, what the bottom slot has left above the prompt. Otherwise the terminal's height. | `number`. Read-only. The slot is capped at half the terminal's rows. A taller tree scrolls in a window of `scroll.bodyRows`. |
| `bodyColumns` | <Documented /> | Cells the tree is laid out in. | `number`. Read-only. Size a table to this value, not to `viewport.columns`. |
| `scroll` | <Documented /> | The window over a tree taller than `maxRows`. Engine-owned. Moved by the wheel and by the person's keys while the band is focused. | `SiteScroll`. `bodyRows` is `maxRows` less the `n more` row. |
| `view` | <Documented /> | Which transcript is on screen above the band: the main conversation or one agent's. | `SiteView`. Read-only. A switch of view re-runs the hook. |

### Pane

The framed region a plugin opened with `$.ui.open({ id })`. There is one instance for each id (`requestId`). The body is the hook's tree. One pane shows, the rest are tabs. The surface places it (docked in fullscreen, otherwise above the prompt). The person closes it, which raises `ui.close` with origin `person`, and a hook may refuse.

| Item | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | <Documented /> | The label of its tab while more than one pane is open. | `string`. Read-only here. Another `$.ui.open`, or a hook on `ui.open`, retitles it. |
| `isFocused` | <Documented /> | True while the person has given the pane the keyboard. Tab walks its elements, a Button's `hotkey` presses it, and the arrows scroll. | `boolean`. Read-only. |
| `bodyColumns` | <Documented /> | Cells across the body, inside the frame. | `number`. Read-only. |
| `placement` | <Documented /> | Where the surface seated the pane: `dock` beside the transcript (the terminal in fullscreen from 110 columns), or `inline` above the prompt. | `'dock' \| 'inline'`. Read-only. A change is refused. |
| `scroll` | <Documented /> | The window of the body over the tree. Engine-owned. | `SiteScroll`. `bodyRows` is the room the frame may use. Inline, the frame fits the tree. |
| `view` | <Documented /> | Which transcript is on screen beside the pane. | `SiteView`. The pane stays open across a switch of view. |

## JSX and Globals

| Item | Status | What it does | How it works | Where it can be used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `h(tag, props, ...children)` | <Documented /> | The JSX factory (classic runtime). Returns a plain-data element from a string tag or a component. | JSX compiles to bare `h(...)` calls. A module must not declare, import, or take as a parameter anything named `h` or `Fragment` where it writes JSX. The engine adds the pragma. | Hooks modules and surface modules. |
| `Fragment` | <Documented /> | `<>...</>`. A column `Box` around the children. | The same naming rule as `h`. | Hooks modules and surface modules. |
| `JSX` namespace | <Documented /> | `Element` is `RenderElement`. `IntrinsicElements` is empty, so there are no string tags. `IntrinsicAttributes` allows `key`. | Every tag is a constructor from `$.ui.resolve(e)`, as in `const { Box, Text } = $.ui.resolve(e)`. | Files named `.tsx` or `.jsx`. |
| Web globals | <Documented /> | `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, `AbortController`, `AbortSignal`, `atob`, `btoa`, `structuredClone`, `crypto.subtle.digest`, `crypto.randomUUID`, `crypto.getRandomValues`, and `performance.now`. | There is no DOM, no Node, no `require`, and no `import()`. `eval` and `new Function` over a string throw. There is no `WebAssembly`. A surface module also has `console` and no timers. | Hooks modules and surface modules. |
| Module rules | <Documented /> | A file ends in `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.mts`, or `.cts`. It is an ES module whatever its suffix. | A file of the plugin is imported with an `import` declaration. A module with `import()` does not load. `on`, `$`, `$.env` names, and `$.state` references must be spelled literally. | Hooks modules. |
