## Types with Fields

Each type below has its own table of fields.

### `PreToolUseDecision`

The decision of a `classic.PreToolUse` result: `allow`, `ask`, `deny`, or none.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allow` | <Documented /> | Lets the call run without a permission prompt. The managed-settings hooks ran first. A deny from them ended the chain above. | Type: `true`. |
| `ask` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `deny` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `ask` | <Documented /> | Asks the user before the call runs. The engine displays the text as the reason. | Type: `string`. |
| `allow` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `deny` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `deny` | <Documented /> | Refuses the call. The model receives the text as the reason. | Type: `string`. |
| `allow` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `ask` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |

### `PreToolUseHookInput`

Combines `PreToolUseHookInput`, `BaseHookInput`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hook_event_name` | <Documented /> | The event name: always `PreToolUse`. | Type: `'PreToolUse'`. |

### `PreToolUseResult`

What a `classic.PreToolUse` hook returns: one of `allow`, `ask`, `deny`, or none of them. None passes the call on to the normal permission flow. Intersection of `PreToolUseResult` and `PreToolUseDecision`. The event fires inside `tool.call`, beneath the `tool.call` hook of every plugin.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
