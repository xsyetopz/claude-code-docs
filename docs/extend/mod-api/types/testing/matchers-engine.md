## Types with Fields

Each type below has its own table of fields.

### `AsymmetricMatcher`

A value that matches by a rule inside `toEqual` and its kin (`expect.any`, `expect.objectContaining`), A failure names it by its text. Object with fields `text`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The text that names the matcher in a failure message. | Type: `string`. Read-only. |

### `AsyncMatchers`

The same checks on what a promise received settles with. Each resolves once the promise has settled and the check passed. Object with fields `[K in keyof Matchers]`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[K in keyof Matchers]` | <Documented /> | For each matcher, the same check, as a call that returns a promise. | Type: `(...args: Parameters<Matchers[K]>) => Promise<void>`. |

### `ClientScope`

Which `Client` of a mounted drawing an act or a read means, by the `key` that its element carries. It is optional while the drawing holds exactly one. Object with fields `in?`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `in` | <Documented /> | The `key` of the `Client` element. Optional while the drawing holds exactly one. | Type: `string`. Optional. |

### `ElementOfAct`

The element that each surface-dependent act of a mounted drawing reaches. A handle carries the act only where the table of the surface has the element. Object with the fields `input`, `select`, `key`, `pointer`, `post`, `advance`, `resize`. `input` needs an `Input` and `select` needs a `Select`. The others reach a `Client`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | <Documented /> | The element the `input` act reaches. | Type: `'Input'`. |
| `select` | <Documented /> | The element the `select` act reaches. | Type: `'Select'`. |
| `key` | <Documented /> | The element the `key` act reaches. | Type: `'Client'`. |
| `pointer` | <Documented /> | The element the `pointer` act reaches. | Type: `'Client'`. |
| `post` | <Documented /> | The element the `post` act reaches. | Type: `'Client'`. |
| `advance` | <Documented /> | The element the `advance` act reaches. | Type: `'Client'`. |
| `resize` | <Documented /> | The element the `resize` act reaches. | Type: `'Client'`. |

### `ElementQuery`

What `find` and `findAll` of a mounted drawing match an element on, with every field given at once: its tag, its `key`, and the text it shows. Object with the fields `type?`, `key?`, `text?`, `in?`. `text` matches the whole shown text: a string by inclusion, a `RegExp` by test.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | <Documented /> | The tag of the element to match. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `key` | <Documented /> | The `key` of the element to match. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The text that the element shows. A string matches by inclusion, a RegExp by test. | Type: `string \| RegExp`. Optional. |
| `in` | <Documented /> | Searches what the surface module of this `Client` drew (by the key of the `Client`) instead of the own tree of the plugin. | Type: `string`. Optional. |

### `Engine`

What a test holds as `$`, the own `$` of the engine. Every call on it works as the calls of the REPL, the query loop and the render sites, over every plugin. Object with one call for each event noun, plus `classic`. `next.origin` is the engine. `$.ui.mount` draws an instance. `press`, `input`, and `select` act on it.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[N in keyof EventCalls]` | <Documented /> | One entry for each noun in `EventCalls`. | Type: `N extends 'ui' ? EngineNoun<N> & EnginePress & EngineInput & EngineSelect & EngineMount : EngineNoun<N>`. |
| `classic` | <Documented /> | The classic events, raised as the engine raises them. | Type: `EngineClassic`. |

### `EngineClassic`

The classic (settings) hook events as the engine raises them: each is a call that runs the `classic.<Event>` chain over every plugin hooked on it. Object with one call for each classic event. The `on('classic.<Event>')` of the test is the bottom of the chain. Example: `await $.classic.SessionStart({ source: 'clear' })`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[E in ClassicEvent]` | <Documented /> | For each classic event, a call that runs the `classic.*` chain and resolves to its result. | Type: `` (e: ClassicFields<E>) => Promise<ClassicResultOf[`classic.${E}`]> ``. |

### `EngineInput`

A surface that types into an Input that a test rendered. The `ui.input` chain runs over every plugin hooked on it, with the own handler of the Input last. Object with fields `input`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | <Documented /> | Types into the Input, as an edit (`kind` `change`, reaching `onInput`) or Enter (`submit`, the default, reaching `onSubmit`) with that text. | Type: `(target: InputTarget) => Promise<UiInputResult \| undefined>`. Types text into an `Input`. Rejects if no such input is drawn, or several are and none is named. |

### `EngineMount`

A surface draws a component instance through the plugins. The test then drives it by key through a handle typed by that surface (Mounted). Object with the field `mount`. It raises `ui.render` for those props, checks the tree, and runs its `Client` modules.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mount` | <Documented /> | Raises the drawing of the component by the plugins on the surface and holds it, as that surface does when it shows the instance. | Type: `<P extends RenderSurface, C extends RenderComponent>(target: MountTarget<P, C>) => Promise<Mounted<P, C>>`. Draws a component on a surface. Rejects if the surface cannot draw the tree. |

### `EngineNoun`

One noun of the `$` of the engine: each of its events as the engine calls it. `tool.call` is typed for each tool (`EngineToolCall`) and `ui.render` for each component. `ui.resolve` is out. Object with fields `[V in EngineNounEvent<N>]`. `skill.prompt` takes the input of a call: its frontmatter and source may be left out, as a test written before the event carried them does.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[V in EngineNounEvent<N>]` | <Documented /> | One entry for each event of that noun. | Type: `` `${N}.${V}` extends 'tool.call' ? EngineToolCall : `${N}.${V}` extends 'ui.render' \| 'skill.prompt' ? EventCalls[N][V] : EngineCall<`${N}.${V}` & EventName> ``. |

### `EnginePress`

A surface that presses a Button that a test rendered, or a link of a Markdown. The `ui.press` chain runs over every plugin hooked on it, with its own closure last. Object with fields `press`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `press` | <Documented /> | Presses the Button, as a click or its hotkey does, with `link`, the Markdown's link, as a click on it does. | Type: `(target: PressTarget) => Promise<UiPressResult \| undefined>`. Presses an element. Resolves once all the work that `onPress` started has settled. Rejects if no such element is drawn. |

### `EngineSelect`

A surface that picks an option of a Select that a test rendered. The `ui.select` chain runs over every plugin hooked on it, with the own `onSelect` of the Select last. Object with fields `select`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `select` | <Documented /> | Picks the option, as choosing it on the surface does. It resolves once the chain, `onSelect` and the work it started have settled. | Type: `(target: SelectTarget) => Promise<UiSelectResult \| undefined>`. Picks a value in a `Select`. Example: `await $.ui.select({ plugin: 'notes', key: 'sort', value: 'date' })`. |

### `Expectation`

What `expect(received)` answers: the checks, their negation, and the checks on what a promise received resolves or rejects with. Combines `Expectation`, `Negatable`, `Matchers`. Object with fields `resolves`, `rejects`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `resolves` | <Documented /> | The checks on what the promise received resolves with. A rejection fails them. | Type: `Negatable<AsyncMatchers>`. |
| `rejects` | <Documented /> | The checks on what the promise received rejects with. A resolution fails them. | Type: `Negatable<AsyncMatchers>`. |

### `FoundElement`

One element of a mounted drawing as `find` returns it. It is the description that the hook of the plugin (or the module of a `Client`) built, read as plain data. Object with fields `type`, `key`, `props`, `text`, `children`. It is what every surface is handed to draw, not what any surface painted: the same on the terminal, the desktop, VS Code and mobile.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | <Documented /> | The tag of the element: `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Client`, ... | Type: `string`. |
| `key` | <Documented /> | What its props carry as `key`, when they do. | Type: `string \| undefined`. |
| `props` | <Documented /> | Its props, plain data: the `label` of a Button, the `color` of a Text, ... Handlers never cross (the `onPress` of a Button is not here). | Type: `Record<string, unknown>`. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | What it shows: its string children in document order and, for the leaves that draw a prop as text, that prop (ElementQuery `text`). | Type: `string`. |
| `children` | <Documented /> | Its children as drawn: strings and element descriptions. | Type: `unknown[]`. |

### `InputTarget`

What `$.ui.input` takes. It has the plugin whose hook drew the Input, its `key`, the text of the field, and which input it is. It also has the instance and surface when several. Object with fields `plugin`, `key`, `text`, `kind?`, `requestId?`, `surface?`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `plugin` | <Documented /> | The plugin whose hook drew the Input. | Type: `string`. |
| `key` | <Documented /> | The `key` of the Input. | Type: `string`. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The whole text of the field at that moment: `e.value` for the chain. | Type: `string`. |
| `kind` | <Documented /> | `submit` (the default) is Enter with that text and reaches `onSubmit`. `change` is one edit left in the field and reaches `onInput`. | Type: `UiInputArgument['kind']`. Optional. A person typing is a run of `change`s, then a `submit`. |
| `requestId` | <Documented /> | Which instance holds it, when the plugin drew the key in several. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `surface` | <Documented /> | Which surface's drawing, when the key is drawn on more than one. The input carries the surface of the drawing that it lands in either way. | Type: `RenderSurface`. Optional. |

### `Matchers`

The checks that `expect(received)` offers. Each throws an AssertionError when it fails, and names what was expected and what was received. Object with 23 matchers: the `toBe` family, the `toContain` family, `toHaveLength`, `toHaveProperty`, `toMatch`, `toStartWith`, `toEndWith`, `toBeInstanceOf`, and `toThrow`.

| `toThrow` | <Documented /> | Passes when calling received throws (or, under `rejects`, the rejection is) an error as described: by substring, pattern, class or message. | Type: `(expected?: ThrowExpectation) => void`. Parameter `expected`: the description. Any throw passes without one. |

### `Matching`

The matchers that stand inside an expected value, each matching received there by a rule instead of by equality. Object with fields `any`, `anything`, `stringContaining`, `stringMatching`, `objectContaining`, `arrayContaining`.
