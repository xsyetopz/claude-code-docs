## Types with Fields

Each type below has its own table of fields.

### `Mock`

The world beneath the plugins, mocked noun by noun: each member registers hooks of the test on `on`. The hooks are visible where the test calls it. Object with fields `clock`, `store`, `env`, `session`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clock` | <Documented /> | Answers `$.clock` from a clock in memory that moves only when the test moves it: `clock.now` reads it, and the clock holds each wait. | Type: `(on: On, options?: MockClockOptions) => MockClock`. A fake clock. A held wait resolves when an advance crosses its time. `options.now` sets the start time (0 by default). |
| `store` | <Documented /> | Answers `$.store` from a store in memory: `get`, `set`, `delete` and `keys` over it, as the engine keeps the own store of a plugin. | Type: `(on: On, entries?: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>) => void`. Parameter `on`: the test's `on`. Parameter `entries`: what the store holds at the start (nothing when not given). |
| `env` | <Documented /> | Answers `$.env.get` from a set of variables. A variable not listed is unset. | Type: `(on: On, variables: Readonly<Record<string, string>>) => void`. Parameter `on`: the test's `on`. Parameter `variables`: the environment the plugins read. |
| `session` | <Documented /> | Records what is appended to the conversations of the session. It has each row that the kit stored for the `$.session.append` of a plugin, or for the own call of the test. | Type: `(on: On) => MockSession`. Gives a fake session that stores appended rows. Returns the rows appended so far. |

### `MockClock`

The clock that `mock.clock` hands back: the time its hooks answer, and the only ways it moves. Object with fields `now`, `advance`, `set`, `settle`, `sleep`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `now` | <Documented /> | The time now, in milliseconds: what `$.clock.now()` resolves beneath the plugins. | Type: `() => number`. Returns: the time. |
| `advance` | <Documented /> | Moves the clock on, and resolves each wait due on the way (`$.clock.sleep`, `after`, `every`, `sleep` of this clock) in the order it comes due. | Type: `(ms: number) => Promise<void>`. Moves the fake clock by `ms`. Resolves once the clock is there and the event loop settled. |
| `set` | <Documented /> | Moves the clock to a time at or past now, as `advance` would. | Type: `(ms: number) => Promise<void>`. Parameter `ms`: the time, in milliseconds. Returns: resolves once the clock is there and the event loop settled. |
| `settle` | <Documented /> | Lets what is already under way run as far as it can without the clock moving. Every wait due now resolves, and the event loop settles. | Type: `() => Promise<void>`. The same as `advance(0)`. Use it between starting a dispatch and looking at what it did. |
| `sleep` | <Documented /> | Resolves once the clock has moved this far past now: how a hook of the test answers late. | Type: `(ms: number) => Promise<void>`. Parameter `ms`: how far, in milliseconds. Returns: resolves when an advance crosses that time. |

### `MockClockOptions`

Where a mocked clock starts: `now`, in milliseconds (0 when not given). Object with fields `now?`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `now` | <Documented /> | Where the mocked clock starts, in milliseconds. 0 when not given. | Type: `number`. Optional. |

### `MockSession`

The session that `mock.session` hands back: what was appended to its conversations while the test ran. Object with fields `appended`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appended` | <Documented /> | The rows stored so far, oldest first, each as the event carried it: `message` as stored, `door`, `origin`, `uuid` and `agentId`. | Type: `() => readonly SessionAppendInput[]`. A row of a plugin has the door `note`, the plugin as `origin` and a fresh `uuid`. The list leaves out a row that a hook above refused, or the kit. Returns: the rows. |

### `MountedMembers`

Every member that a mounted drawing of component `C` can have. `Mounted<P, C>` keeps the ones that surface `P` has the element for (ElementOfAct). Alias of the members `surface`, `drawn`, `find`, `findAll`, `press`, `input`, `select`, `key`, `pointer`, `post`, `advance`, `resize`, `redraw`, and `unmount`. Each act resolves once its work settles.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | <Documented /> | Where this drawing is, as the test named it. | Type: `P`. Read-only. |
| `drawn` | <Documented /> | The tree as last drawn: what the `ui.render` chain of the plugins returned for this instance, checked by the table of the surface, as plain data. | Type: `(scope?: ClientScope) => Promise<RenderElement>`. Gives the tree. Rejects if the surface could not draw it. Example: `expect(await ui.drawn()).toMatchObject({ type: 'Box' })`. |
| `find` | <Documented /> | The first element matching the query, outermost first in document order, or undefined. | Type: `(query: ElementQuery) => Promise<FoundElement \| undefined>`. Finds one element by tag, key, or text. Example: `(await ui.find({ key: 'count' }))?.text`. |
| `findAll` | <Documented /> | Every element matching the query, in document order. | Type: `(query: ElementQuery) => Promise<FoundElement[]>`. Finds all matching elements. Example: `expect(await ui.findAll({ type: 'Button' })).toHaveLength(2)`. |
| `press` | <Documented /> | Presses the Button keyed `key`, as the person who activates it on this surface does: the `ui.press` chain, with the own `onPress` of the Button last. | Type: `(target: MountPressTarget) => Promise<UiPressResult \| undefined>`. Presses the element with this `key`. With `link` it presses a link of a `Markdown`. Example: `await ui.press({ key: 'save' })`. |
| `input` | <Documented /> | Types into the Input keyed `key`: the `ui.input` chain with the text as `e.value`, with the own handler of the Input last. | Type: `(target: MountInputTarget) => Promise<UiInputResult \| undefined>`. `kind` `submit` (default) is Enter with that text. `change` leaves it in the field. Example: `await ui.input({ key: 'title', text: 'groceries' })`. |
| `select` | <Documented /> | Picks `value` in the Select keyed `key`: the `ui.select` chain, with the own `onSelect` of the Select last. | Type: `(target: MountSelectTarget) => Promise<UiSelectResult \| undefined>`. Picks the option `value` in the `Select` with this `key`. Example: `await ui.select({ key: 'sort', value: 'date' })`. |
| `key` | <Documented /> | Hands the `onKey` listener of a `Client` one key, as a key pressed while its region has the focus does. | Type: `(event: MountKeyEvent) => Promise<void>`. Sends a key to a `Client`. Example: `await ui.key({ key: 'return', in: 'board' })`. |
| `pointer` | <Documented /> | Hands the `onPointer` listener of a `Client` one event, in the cells of its region as every surface that draws a `Client` reports them. | Type: `(event: MountPointerEvent) => Promise<void>`. Sends a pointer event. Example: `await ui.pointer({ type: 'down', x: 2, y: 0, button: 'left' })`. |
| `post` | <Documented /> | Posts as the own `surface.post(data)` of a `Client` does: the `ui.message` hooks of the plugin run with `e.data`, and `e.surface` is this drawing. | Type: `(data: JsonValue, scope?: ClientScope) => Promise<void>`. Posts data to a `Client`. A `{ props }` answer reaches the instance, which redraws with its state kept. |
| `advance` | <Documented /> | Moves the frame clock of the drawing on: each `surface.every(ms, fn)` timer of its `Client`s fires at every interval of its own that the move crosses. | Type: `(ms: number) => Promise<void>`. Parameter `ms`: how far, in milliseconds. Example: `await ui.advance(250)`. |
| `resize` | <Documented /> | Lays the region of a `Client` out at a size, as the surface that measures it does: what its module reads as `surface.columns` and `surface.rows`. | Type: `(size: MountResizeTarget) => Promise<void>`. Parameter `size`: cells across and down, `in`: which `Client`. Example: `await ui.resize({ columns: 40, rows: 3 })`. |
| `redraw` | <Documented /> | Draws the instance again, as the engine does when its props change (the output of a tool row arrived): the `ui.render` chain with the next props. | Type: `(props?: RenderPropsOf[C]) => Promise<void>`. Draws again with new props. A plugin's own `$.ui.invalidate` needs no call. |
| `unmount` | <Documented /> | Lets the drawing go, as the surface that drops the instance does: its `Client`s and their timers end. Later acts on the handle reject. | Type: `() => Promise<void>`. Example: `await ui.unmount()`. |

### `MountInputTarget`
