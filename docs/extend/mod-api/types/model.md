title: Model, Audio, and MCP Types
description: "Types behind $.model, $.audio, and $.mcp."
sidebar_position: 6
---

These are the types behind `$.model`, `$.audio`, and `$.mcp`.
They describe the request and the answer of a model call, the cache marks of a prompt, and the result of an MCP call.

## Example

This call asks a model for one answer. The types below describe the request and the result.

```ts
const r = await $.model.complete({ model: "haiku", prompt, effort: "low" });
```

## Types without Fields

These types are aliases, unions, or plain shapes. Each row gives its use and its shape.

| Type | Status | What it is for | Shape and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `McpConnectRefusal` | <Documented /> | Why `$.mcp.connect` left a server unconnected, in one word. It includes `unlisted` where the host of the session runs the servers of the plugin itself. | Alias of `'unlisted' \| 'unapproved' \| 'disabled' \| 'policy' \| 'auth' \| 'failed'`. Each name says why the connection was refused, such as `auth` for a missing sign-in. |
| `McpToolInputs` | <Documented /> | The inputs of the MCP tools that this project knows, keyed by full tool name, for declaration merging. It is empty by default, and then every MCP tool is loose. | Interface. A `.d.ts` in the project of the author adds entries under `declare module "claude-code"`. Then `e.tool === <name>` narrows to them. |
| `McpToolName` | <Documented /> | The name of an MCP tool as the engine spells it: `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. | Alias of `` `mcp__${string}__${string}` ``. |
| `ModelApiError` | <Documented /> | Which kind of API failure ended a model call (a completion, a fork). It is the word that Claude Code uses to classify every API error (the word of StopFailure). | Alias of the `error` field of the `StopFailure` input. `rate_limit`, `overloaded`, and `server_error` may clear on their own. Others will not. |
| `ModelEffort` | <Documented /> | How hard a request asks the model to think, by the levels that the engine and `turn.step` name: `low` to `max`, with `xhigh` between `high` and `max`. | Alias of `'low' \| 'medium' \| 'high' \| 'xhigh' \| 'max'`. The engine sends no effort setting to a model that takes none, whatever the request asks. |

## Types with Fields

Each type below has its own table of fields.

### `ApiContentBlock`

One content block of an ApiMessage. `type` names its kind (`text`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `image`, `document`, `thinking`, ...). The other fields are the fields of that kind, as the Messages API defines them (see its reference). The engine hands the block over as it holds it, with nothing renamed or dropped.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | <Documented /> | The kind of the block. The rest of the block is the fields of that kind. | Type: `string`. |
| `[field: string]` | <Documented /> | Any other field of the block. Its kind (`type`) decides which fields it has, as the Messages API defines them. | Type: `unknown`. |

### `ApiMessage`

One message of the conversation in Messages API form, as `$.session.messages({ as: "api" })` returns it. They are the messages for the next request. There are at most 4096, and they open on a user message.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `role` | <Documented /> | Who wrote it. | Type: `'user' \| 'assistant'`. |
| `content` | <Documented /> | Its blocks in order, always an array. The blocks are text, tool_use and tool_result (paired across an assistant message and the next), image and document. | Type: `ApiContentBlock[]`. Media blocks stay inline and thinking goes back. The system prompt and the tool list are in no message. |

### `AudioClip`

What `$.audio.play` plays: a URL that the engine fetches, or the bytes. Used by `$.audio.play`, `audio.play`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `asset` | <Documented /> | A file of the calling plugin's own, relative to the directory of the plugin (`fx/open.wav`), with no `.` and no leading slash. | Type: `string`. The engine resolves it and loads the file from disk. |
| `url` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `base64` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `mime` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `url` | <Documented /> | The URL of the clip. The engine fetches it (never the plugin), or refuses it as `$.http.fetch` would refuse the same URL. | Type: `string`. |
| `asset` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `base64` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `mime` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `base64` | <Documented /> | The bytes of the clip, base64. | Type: `string`. |
| `mime` | <Documented /> | What the bytes are (`audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`). | Type: `string`. |
| `asset` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `url` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |

### `ClassifyOptions`

Options of `$.model.classify`. Used by `$.model.classify`, `model.classify`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | <Documented /> | An alias (`haiku`) or a full model id. The default is the small fast model of the engine. | Type: `string`. Optional. |

### `McpConnectResult`

What `$.mcp.connect` resolves to and what the `{ value }` of an `mcp.connect` hook holds: the server connected, or why not. Example: `const browser = await $.mcp.connect("browser")`. Used by `$.mcp.connect`, `mcp.connect`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isConnected` | <Documented /> | True: the server is connected and its tools are the tools of the session. | Type: `true`. |
| `server` | <Documented /> | The name that /mcp lists it under and `$.mcp.call` takes: usually `plugin:<plugin>:<server>`. | Type: `string`. Or the name that the session already uses to run the same server. |
| `isConnected` | <Documented /> | False: the server is not connected. | Type: `false`. |
| `reason` | <Documented /> | Why, in one word. | Type: `McpConnectRefusal`. |
| `message` | <Documented /> | The same reason as one plain sentence, to log or toast. | Type: `string`. |

### `McpContentBlock`

One block of an MCP result: `type` and the fields that kind of block carries.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | <Documented /> | The block's kind: `text`, `image`, `audio`, `resource`, `resource_link`. | Type: `string`. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | Set on a `text` block. | Type: `string`. Optional. |

| `mimeType` | <Documented /> | An image, audio or resource block declares it. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `[field: string]` | <Documented /> | Any other field of the block. Its `type` decides which fields it has. | Type: `unknown`. |

### `McpServerProvenance`

The MCP server that serves this tool. `name` is the config key of the server, and `source` says where its definition came from. Base trust on `source`, not on the name.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | <Documented /> | The config key of the MCP server. | Type: `string`. |
| `source` | <Documented /> | sdk \| plugin \| user \| project \| local \| dynamic \| managed \| enterprise \| claudeai \| agent - an open set. Treat unknown values as an unrecognized configured source, never as sdk. | Type: `string`. |

### `McpToolCallInput`

The MCP branch of the `e` of a `tool.call` hook (and of the input of `$.tool.call`). It has one variant for each declared tool, else the loose McpToolCallInputFallback. Alias of the input types of connected MCP tools. `$.mcp.call(server, tool, args)` does not use it, because its parameters are positional.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[N in keyof McpToolInputs & string]` | <Documented /> | One variant for each declared MCP tool: the input of the tool. | Type: `ToolInputOf<N, McpToolInputs[N] & Record<string, unknown>>`. |

### `McpToolCallInputFallback`

The `e` a `tool.call` (or `classic.PreToolUse`) hook receives for an MCP tool while no MCP tool is declared: every `mcp__*` name, with loose arguments. It is also the `input` of `$.tool.call({ tool: "mcp__<server>__<tool>" })` when no tool types are declared.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | The name of the tool being called (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`). A comparison with it narrows `e`. Reserved: core ignores a rewrite of it. | Type: `McpToolName`. |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The id of the tool_use block. It is the same at every event of the call and in `$.ui.notice`. Reserved: core ignores a rewrite of it. | Type: `string`. |
| `[argument: string]` | <Documented /> | Any argument of the MCP tool, with no type. | Type: `unknown`. |

### `McpToolResult`

An MCP tools/call result as the SDK returns it, plain data. Used by `$.mcp.call`, `mcp.call`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | <Documented /> | The content blocks of the result, in order (text, image, resource, resource_link, ...). | Type: `McpContentBlock[]`. |
| `isError` | <Documented /> | True when the server reported the call as failed. The blocks then describe the error. | Type: `boolean`. |
| `structuredContent` | <Documented /> | The structured result of the server, when its tool declares an output schema. | Type: `unknown`. Optional. |

### `ModelCompleteInput`

What a hook on `model.complete` reads as `e`. It is the request with its text as strings, as it always was. The blocks of the caller are beside them. A list of blocks arrives joined in `prompt` and as given in `promptBlocks`. Used by `model.complete`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | <Documented /> | Which model answers, as the request named it (ModelCompleteRequest). | Type: `string`. |
| `prompt` | <Documented /> | The one user message, as text. It is a string as the caller gave it, or the texts of its blocks joined in order with nothing between them. | Type: `string`. The engine sends it to the model. A hook that passes another string down has rewritten the prompt, whatever `promptBlocks` still says. |
| `system` | <Documented /> | What precedes the completion as its system prompt, as text joined as `prompt` is. Absent when the caller gave none. | Type: `string`. Optional. Passing `null` or `false` down sends none. |
| `promptBlocks` | <Documented /> | The blocks of `prompt` from the caller, as given, when it gave a list. They show where the cache marks are. Absent for a string. | Type: `readonly ModelTextBlock[]`. Optional. They place cache marks and change no text. A rewritten opening keeps no mark. |
| `systemBlocks` | <Documented /> | The blocks of `system` from the caller. Read them against `system` exactly as `promptBlocks` is read against `prompt`. Absent for a string or none. | Type: `readonly ModelTextBlock[]`. Optional. |
| `maxTokens` | <Documented /> | The token cap of the reply, as the request gave it. | Type: `number`. Optional. |
| `effort` | <Documented /> | How hard the model thinks about it, as the request gave it. | Type: `ModelEffort`. Optional. |
| `timeoutMs` | <Documented /> | How long the whole call may take, in milliseconds, as the request gave it. | Type: `number`. Optional. |

### `ModelCompleteOptions`

Options of `$.model.complete`. They are no part of the request, so no hook on `model.complete` reads them on `e`. Used by `$.model.complete`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `signal` | <Documented /> | Aborting it cuts the call while it runs. The call then resolves `aborted`, as when its dispatch aborts. If it is already aborted, no request is made. | Type: `AbortSignal`. Optional. The plugin's own signal. Aborting it cuts the call, which then resolves `aborted`. |

### `ModelCompleteRequest`

What `$.model.complete` takes. Used by `$.model.complete`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | <Documented /> | An alias (`haiku`) or a full model id, The engine resolves it and checks it against the allowlist like a `--model` value. | Type: `string`. |
| `prompt` | <Documented /> | The one user message: a string, or blocks of text sent in order (ModelTextBlock). Any of the blocks may be marked for the prompt cache. | Type: `string \| readonly ModelTextBlock[]`. The result says what happened: text and usage, or a `reason`. Too many cache marks give an API error 400. |
| `system` | <Documented /> | Precedes the completion as its system prompt, after the identity block of the CLI: a string, or blocks of text as `prompt` takes. Default none. | Type: `string \| readonly ModelTextBlock[]`. Optional. Note: On Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry or behind a gateway, the cache finds text marked here again only while `prompt` opens the same. Mark it there. |
| `maxTokens` | <Documented /> | The token cap of the reply: any positive integer up to what one reply can hold. That is the own output limit of the model or 64000, whichever is lower. | Type: `number`. Optional. Default 1024. The reply comes back whole, not streamed, A provider ends such a request at ten minutes, hence the 64000. The engine refuses a value past the limit, and names the limit. |
| `effort` | <Documented /> | How hard the model thinks about it (ModelEffort): `low` for a cheap label, `max` for a hard judgment. The default is the own effort of the model. | Type: `ModelEffort`. Optional. The engine sends it where the model takes an effort and drops it where the model does not. It refuses a value outside the five levels. |
| `timeoutMs` | <Documented /> | How long the whole call may take, in milliseconds, before it resolves `aborted` and the engine abandons the request. The default is none. | Type: `number`. Optional. Bounds the completion itself. A positive whole number up to 2147483647. The engine refuses anything else. |

### `ModelCompleteResult`

What one model call resolves to: the reply when the model answered (`isAnswered`). Otherwise it says which of three things left the call without text (`reason`). A provider failure never rejects the call. Branch on `isAnswered` and `reason`. Used by `$.model.complete`, `model.complete`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isAnswered` | <Documented /> | True: the model answered, and `text` and `usage` are its reply. | Type: `true`. Example: `if (r.isAnswered) spent += r.usage.output_tokens`. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The text of the reply: for a completion, its text blocks joined. On a fork, the text of the non-error replies joined by newlines. | Type: `string`. |
| `usage` | <Documented /> | What the call cost (ModelUsage). On a fork, the sum of its completions. | Type: `ModelUsage`. On a fork, `cache_read_input_tokens` near zero means the fork paid for the whole prefix. |
| `isAnswered` | <Documented /> | `false`: the model gave no text. | Type: `false`. |
| `reason` | <Documented /> | The API answered with an error and no reply carried text. | Type: `'api-error'`. Example: `if (!r.isAnswered && r.reason === "api-error") retry(r.status)`. |
| `status` | <Documented /> | The HTTP status of the error reply (429, 500, 529, ...). It is null when no response arrived at all (a dropped connection, a provider timeout). | Type: `number \| null`. |
| `error` | <Documented /> | Which kind of failure, as Claude Code classifies API errors. It is never the text or body of the error. | Type: `ModelApiError`. `rate_limit`, `overloaded`, `invalid_request`, `authentication_failed`, `server_error`, ..., `unknown` when it fits none of the named kinds. |
| `usage` | <Documented /> | What the call cost before it failed: all zeros for a completion (its one request was the one refused). On a fork, the turns before it. | Type: `ModelUsage`. |
| `isAnswered` | <Documented /> | `false`: the model gave no text. | Type: `false`. |
| `reason` | <Documented /> | The model replied and its reply carried no text. | Type: `'empty-reply'`. The reply held no text block, or a fork answered only with a denied tool attempt. |
| `usage` | <Documented /> | What the call cost. | Type: `ModelUsage`. |
| `isAnswered` | <Documented /> | `false`: the model gave no text. | Type: `false`. |
| `reason` | <Documented /> | The call was cut before a reply came. The engine discards whatever had come back. | Type: `'aborted'`. The dispatch aborted, the plugin unloaded, `options.signal` fired, or `timeoutMs` ended. |
| `usage` | <Documented /> | What the call cost before it was cut: all zeros for a completion (no response arrived). On a fork, what came back before the abort. | Type: `ModelUsage`. |

### `ModelForkRequest`

What `$.model.fork` takes. Used by `$.model.fork`, `model.fork`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | <Documented /> | The one user message, appended to the own transcript of the session as the main thread last sent it. | Type: `string`. The result says what happened: text and usage, or a `reason` such as `nothing-to-fork`. |

### `ModelForkResult`

What `$.model.fork` resolves to: a completion's result (ModelCompleteResult) or that there was nothing to fork yet. Union. Fields: `isAnswered`, `reason`. The completion's arms are the reply when the fork answered, else `api-error`, `empty-reply` or `aborted`, `usage` on each. Used by `$.model.fork`, `model.fork`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isAnswered` | <Documented /> | `false`: the fork gave no text. | Type: `false`. |
| `reason` | <Documented /> | Nothing to fork, so no request was made: the session holds no snapshot of the main thread of this conversation that a fork may share. | Type: `'nothing-to-fork'`. No turn has run yet, or the conversation started afresh after `/clear` or a resume. |

### `ModelTextBlock`

One block of text in the `prompt` or `system` of a `$.model.complete` request. The engine sends it as written, in the order given. You can mark it for the prompt cache. Put the text that every call repeats first, and mark its last block with `cache`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The text of the block, sent as written. An empty one is the API's to refuse, as an `api-error` of status 400. | Type: `string`. |
| `cache` | <Documented /> | Keeps the request up to and including this block in the prompt cache. A call within five minutes that opens with the same text reads it there. | Type: `true`. Optional. The `usage` of the result shows `cache_creation_input_tokens` or `cache_read_input_tokens`. Both zero means nothing was cached. |

### `ModelUsage`

What one model call cost, as the API counted it. It has the four token counts in the spelling of the API, summed over the responses of the call when it made several. One shape for every place that reports the cost of a call. All four counts are always present. A missing count reads as zero.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input_tokens` | <Documented /> | Uncached input tokens the call was answered over: the part of the prompt that the call neither read from nor wrote to the prompt cache. | Type: `number`. |
| `output_tokens` | <Documented /> | Tokens the call generated. | Type: `number`. |
| `cache_read_input_tokens` | <Documented /> | Input tokens that the prompt cache served. | Type: `number`. On a fork, how much of the transcript of the main thread the cache still held. Near zero means the fork paid for the whole prefix (the entry had lapsed, or the model changed since the entry was made). |
| `cache_creation_input_tokens` | <Documented /> | Input tokens that the call wrote to the prompt cache. | Type: `number`. |

### `PlayOptions`

How `$.audio.play` plays a clip: looped until `signal` aborts, or once. A loop needs the signal that ends it. A single play takes one as an option. Used by `$.audio.play`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shouldLoop` | <Documented /> | Repeat the clip until `signal` aborts (the promise then resolves). | Type: `true`. |
| `gain` | <Documented /> | Linear gain, from 0 to 4, default 1. | Type: `number`. Optional. |
| `signal` | <Documented /> | Stops the clip: playback ends at once and the promise resolves. | Type: `AbortSignal`. |
| `shouldLoop` | <Documented /> | Play once. | Type: `false`. Optional. |
| `gain` | <Documented /> | Linear gain, from 0 to 4, default 1. | Type: `number`. Optional. |
| `signal` | <Documented /> | Stops the clip early, as above. | Type: `AbortSignal`. Optional. |

### `SpeakOptions`

Options of `$.audio.speak`. Used by `$.audio.speak`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `voice` | <Documented /> | The exact name of the system voice as the platform lists it (`Samantha`, or the name of a voice you installed). If absent, the synthesizer uses its default voice. | Type: `string`. Optional. |

### `SpeakRequest`

The argument of `$.audio.speak(text, options)` as the event carries it. Combines `SpeakRequest`, `SpeakOptions`. Used by `audio.speak`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | <Documented /> | What to say, as plain text: the system speaks its first 4096 characters. | Type: `string`. |

### `SpeakResult`

What `$.audio.speak` resolves with once the utterance has ended. Used by `$.audio.speak`, `audio.speak`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `via` | <Documented /> | Which synthesizer spoke: `system`, the own synthesizer of the platform (`say` on macOS). | Type: `'system'`. |
