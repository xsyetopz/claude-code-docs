## Types with Fields

Each type below has its own table of fields.

### `ToolCallReserved`

The keys that the input of `tool.call` carries beside the own arguments of the tool. The tool sees none of them (the engine strips them before the tool runs). `consent` is the own words of the person for the press that raised the call. The permission path reads it as the request of the user.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | The name of the tool. | Type: `T`. |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The ID of the tool call. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `consent` | <Documented /> | The own words of the person for the press that raised the call. The tool never sees it. | Type: `string`. Optional. |

### `ToolCallResult`

What a `tool.call` hook returns and what `next(e)` and `$.tool.call(input)` resolve to: the result of the tool (`{ result, context? }`) or `{ deny }`. Union. Fields: `context`, `deny`, `isError`, `isReadOnly`, `ref`, `result`, `text`. From core the result is `{ ref, result, text }`, plus `isError` on a tool error. Used by `tool.call`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deny` | <Documented /> | Refuses the call: the model receives the text as an error result. Absent when the call was answered. | Type: `string`. A deny that a hook returns after the tool answered without error withholds that result and undoes nothing. In its place the model reads `<tool> ran, and a plugin withheld its result: <text>`. |
| `result` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `context` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `ref` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `isError` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `isReadOnly` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `result` | <Documented /> | The output of the tool: from core the record of the tool, typed for each built-in tool once `e.tool` and `isError` are narrowed. From a hook, its own. | Type: `ToolResultOf<Name>`. Core checks the answer of a hook against the output schema of the tool when it has one. Absent on a deny. |
| `context` | <Documented /> | What the model reads after the result of the tool, and the user never sees. From core, none. | Type: `readonly string[]`. Optional. One reminder, as that of a `PostToolUse` hook. Past 100,000 characters (200,000 together) the model reads a head and a path. |
| `ref` | <Documented /> | Core sets it on what `next(e)` resolves to. It names the messages that core produced for the call (they stay on the host side). | Type: `number`. Optional. A hook that returns the object it got makes core use them verbatim. Absent on the own `{ result }` of a hook and on a deny. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | Core sets it: the result as the model reads it (text blocks joined). It is present whatever the tool, where the shape of `result` varies for each tool. | Type: `string`. Optional. Absent on the own `{ result }` of a hook. |
| `isReadOnly` | <Documented /> | Core sets it. It is present only when the tool held the input it executed read-only by its own check (the check that its permissions use). | Type: `true`. Optional. Says the call ran read-only, rewrites included. It does not cover calls that this call causes. |
| `isError` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `deny` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |
| `isError` | <Documented /> | Core sets it. It is present only when the tool reported an error (it threw, was interrupted, or answered an error). `text` is what the model read. | Type: `true`. |
| `result` | <Documented /> | What the transcript stored for the errored call: the error text, or undefined when nothing was stored. It is never the typed record of the tool. | Type: `unknown`. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The error as the model reads it. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `ref` | <Documented /> | As on an answered result: names the messages that core produced. | Type: `number`. Optional. |
| `context` | <Documented /> | As on an answered result. | Type: `readonly string[]`. Optional. |
| `isReadOnly` | <Documented /> | As on an answered result: the tool held the input it ran read-only. | Type: `true`. Optional. |
| `deny` | <Documented /> | Never set in this form. | Type: `undefined`. Optional. |

### `ToolCheckInput`

The input of `tool.check`. It has the tool and its arguments. It also has the ceiling of the organization if it set one, whether the call is read-only, and who can answer an ask. On a real call it also has the id of the call and the `agentId` of the loop. All fields are pinned. A hook decides about the call and does not change it. Used by `tool.check`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | As the model names it (`Bash`, `mcp__server__tool`), the key that a matcher narrows on. | Type: `string`. A matcher on any name that the host declares for the tool admits it. |
| `input` | <Documented /> | The arguments of the tool as the permission decision reads them (`{ command }` for Bash, `{ file_path, ... }` for the file tools). | Type: `unknown`. |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The call being decided, on a real call only. Absent on a query. | Type: `string`. Optional. `next.origin` names who raised it: `{ plugin: 'engine', tier: 'core' }` for the own call of the model, the plugin for its `$.tool.call` or its query. |
| `agentId` | <Documented /> | The id of the loop that decides the call. It is on a real call inside the loop of a subagent or a teammate: the one that its `tool.call` carried. | Type: `string`. Optional. Absent on the main loop and on a query. It says which loop, not which plugin caused the call (`next.origin` says that). |
| `isReadOnly` | <Documented /> | Set when the tool call is read-only (new in 2.1.304). | Type: `true`. Optional. The program passes it on as the read-only flag of the permission decision. |
| `approver` | <Documented /> | Who answers this evaluation's asks, known before any hook runs (new in 2.1.307). | Type: `ToolCheckApprover`. Optional. Set by the engine and pinned. `host` when a hosted session's permission callback or prompt tool, or the cloud session a served call is for, answers. `person` when a person can be asked, a pane's card included. Absent when nobody can be asked (`dontAsk` mode, avoid-prompts, headless). |
| `ceiling` | <Documented /> | The most permissive verdict that the organization lets a call of the tool reach (`ask`), as its administrators set it on the tool of a connector. | Type: `ToolCheckDecision`. Optional. Set by the engine, from the tool, never by a query, and pinned. The own `ceiling` of a hook, on its answer, is dropped. Absent where none is set. |

### `ToolCheckResult`

What a `tool.check` hook returns and what `next(e)` resolves to: the verdict, why, and what stands behind it. It is never who answers it. From core, it is the decision of the engine for the mode and rules. A hook may answer any verdict. The last word up the chain decides. Used by `tool.check`, `$.tool.check`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `decision` | <Documented /> | `allow` runs the tool. `ask` puts it to the decider of the mode, or to a person when a hook made it (`plugin`). `deny` refuses it, with the reason as the error of the model. | Type: `ToolCheckDecision`. For a tool that needs the person, a hook can only tighten the verdict. Its `allow` does not dismiss the dialog. |
| `reason` | <Documented /> | Why, in a sentence. From core, it is the rule or check that decided. From a hook, it is what the model reads on a deny and the dialog shows on an ask. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `rule` | <Documented /> | The settings rule that decided, as written (`Bash(git push:*)`). | Type: `string`. Optional. Absent for a mode or the own check of a tool. |
| `hook` | <Documented /> | The classic hook event that decided, or whose ask the verdict was reached under (`PreToolUse`), whoever configured the hook. | Type: `string`. Optional. Absent on a `$.tool.check` query, which runs no classic hook. |
| `setting` | <Documented /> | The key of the option whose own check asked, whoever configured it (`permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories`). | Type: `string`. Optional. From core, for the read block: its ask on a shell command that reads outside the working directories or, the block on, leaves the sandbox. |
| `plugin` | <Documented /> | The plugin whose hook made this ask (new in 2.1.307). | Type: `string`. Optional. Set by the engine and pinned. What a hook writes here is dropped. Set on an `ask` that a hook answered, a reworded ask included. An ask a hook passes up unchanged keeps what it carried, so core's own ask names none. Such an ask is a person's: the dialog, the host's callback, or a `PermissionRequest` hook answers it. No classifier's allow settles it, its block still refuses, and a rule for the whole tool is not kept. A narrower rule the person saves settles nothing while the hook asks. Where nobody can be asked (`approver` absent), the program turns the ask into a deny, and its reason is the model's error. A tool that raises no prompt keeps its own rule. |
| `decider` | <Undocumented /> <Deprecated note="Removed from the type file in 2.1.307." /> | The 2.1.304 to 2.1.306 way for a hook to put its ask to a person. | Type: `'host' \| 'person'`. Optional. The 2.1.309 program still reads `decider: "person"` on a hook's answer and marks the answer with `plugin`. It ignores any other value, and no result carries `decider` (the program). Use `ask` alone since 2.1.307: every ask a hook makes goes to a person. |
| `ceiling` | <Documented /> | The most permissive verdict that the organization lets a call of the tool reach (`ask`), as its administrators set it on the tool of a connector. | Type: `ToolCheckDecision`. Optional. Set by the engine from the tool. The own `ceiling` of a hook is dropped. |

### `ToolDescribeInput`

The input of `tool.describe`: the description of one tool, at the moment the engine first renders the schema of the tool for the model. Used by `tool.describe`, `$.tool.describe`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | As the model sees the name (`Bash`, `mcp__server__tool`), the key that a matcher narrows on. | Type: `string`. |
| `description` | <Documented /> | The description of the tool as the tool computed it. | Type: `string`. |
| `isDeferred` | <Documented /> | Present, and true, when the engine lists the tool behind ToolSearch (its schema loads when the model asks for it by name). Absent for a tool that the engine lists in front. | Type: `true`. Optional. The tool of an MCP server loads on demand, and so does a tool that asks to. A plugin tool with `isDeferred: false` stays in front. |
| `provider` | <Documented /> | Who provides this tool: the plugin and its tier, `{ plugin: "engine", tier: "core" }` for a built-in. Pinned: a rewrite is refused. | Type: `Origin`. The tool of a configured MCP server is `mcp:<server>`. It is in `prepend` when the policy settings source configures the server, else in `user`. |

### `ToolDescribeResult`

What a `tool.describe` hook returns: the description that the model sees for that tool and, when the hook moves it, where the tool waits (ToolDeferral). `{ description }` alone changes the text and keeps the placement. `isDeferred: true` puts the tool behind ToolSearch. Used by `tool.describe`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | <Documented /> | The description the model sees for the tool. | Type: `string`. |
| `isDeferred` | <Documented /> | Where the tool waits. `true` puts it behind ToolSearch. | Type: `ToolDeferral`. Optional. |

### `ToolEnvelope`

`{ tool, tool_use_id, ...args }` as one flat object type, generic over the tool name and its parsed arguments.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | The name of the tool being called (`Bash`, `mcp__<server>__<tool>`). A comparison with it narrows `e`. Reserved: core ignores a rewrite of it. | Type: `Name`. |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The id of the tool_use block. It is the same at every event of the call and in `$.ui.notice`. Reserved: core ignores a rewrite of it. | Type: `string`. |

### `ToolInfo`

One tool as `$.tool.list()` returns it. Used by `$.tool.list`, `tool.list`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | <Documented /> | What the model calls it by. | Type: `string`. |
| `description` | <Documented /> | What it does, in the own words of the tool (its description, at most a first sentence for MCP tools without one). | Type: `string`. |
| `mcp` | <Documented /> | True for the tool of an MCP server. | Type: `boolean`. |

### `ToolInputOf`

`{ tool, tool_use_id, ...args }` as one flat object type. The docs of `tool` and `tool_use_id` live on the `keyof` operand: a mapped type takes the docs of its properties from there.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[K in keyof ToolEnvelope<Name, Arguments>]` | <Documented /> | Each key of the tool envelope, with its type unchanged. | Type: `ToolEnvelope<Name, Arguments>[K]`. |

### `ToolNamed`

An input that names its tool as the literal `T`: what `next` and `$.tool.call` read to type the result of the call for each tool (NextResultFor).

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | The name of the tool being called (`Bash`). | Type: `T`. Read-only. |

### `ToolRequestMeta`

What a `tool.call` hook sets for the request of the tool of an MCP server.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `requestMeta` | <Documented /> | Entries for the `_meta` of the request that this call sends to its MCP server. Set them with `next({ ...e, requestMeta })`. They are never an argument of the tool. | Type: `Record<string, string>`. Optional. A hook may set only `anthropic/sources`, a string of at most 256 KiB. It goes only to a connector relay. `{}` clears it. |

### `ToolResultSummary`

One tool_result block of a user message.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The id of the call that this result answers (`e.tool_use_id` of `tool.call`). | Type: `string`. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The result as the model read it (text blocks joined). | Type: `string`. |
| `isError` | <Documented /> | True when the tool reported an error. | Type: `boolean`. |
| `result` | <Documented /> | What the transcript stored for the call: the record of the tool on an answered call (`result` of `tool.call`), the error text when `isError`. | Type: `unknown`. Optional. Absent when nothing was stored. In `-p` a tool may store the record without its bulk. `text` is what the model read. |
| `meta` | <Documented /> | What the MCP server of the tool addressed to plugins in `_meta`: entries under `"claude/plugins"` and `"anthropic/sources"`. The model never reads it. The engine leaves out a key over 256 KiB. | Type: `Record<string, unknown>`. Optional. Off by default. Absent on an error result, and when the server addressed nothing. A subagent's transcript keeps at most 8 KiB. |

### `ToolSpec`

What `$.tool.register` takes. Used by `$.tool.register`.

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | <Documented /> | The short name of the tool (letters, digits, `_`, `-`, up to 64). The model calls it as `mcp__<plugin>__<name>`. | Type: `string`. |
| `description` | <Documented /> | What the tool does, for the model (and the person where tools are listed). The engine draws an unpaired surrogate half in it as U+FFFD. | Type: `string`. |
| `inputSchema` | <Documented /> | A JSON schema object for the input (`{ type: "object", properties, required }`). The default is `{ type: "object" }`. | Type: `Record<string, unknown>`. Optional. |
| `isDeferred` | <Documented /> | Where the tool waits: `false` puts its schema in the prompt's tool list, `true` behind ToolSearch. | Type: `ToolDeferral`. Optional. If left out, the rule of the engine places it: behind ToolSearch, as it places the tool of an MCP server. The answer of a `tool.describe` hook is read first. |

### `ToolUseSummary`

One tool_use block of an assistant message, with its outcome once the transcript holds the tool_result of the call (paired by `tool_use_id`).

| Field | Status | What it is for | Type and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_use_id` | <Documented /> | The id of the call, as `tool.call` carried it (`e.tool_use_id` there). | Type: `string`. |
| `tool` | <Documented /> | Which one was called (`Read`, `Bash`, `mcp__server__tool`), as `tool.call` named it (`e.tool` there). | Type: `string`. |
| `input` | <Documented /> | The arguments the model gave it. | Type: `Record<string, unknown>`. |
| `result` | <Documented /> | What the transcript stored for the call. On an answered call, it is the record of the tool (`result` of `tool.call`). On a refused or errored call, it is the error text. | Type: `unknown`. Optional. Absent while the call is in flight or when nothing was stored. `text` holds either way. |
| `text` | <Documented /> | The result as the model read it. Absent while the call is in flight. | Type: `string`. Optional. |
| `isError` | <Documented /> | Present only when the tool reported an error, as on the result of `tool.call`. | Type: `true`. Optional. |
| `agentId` | <Documented /> | On an Agent tool use, the id of the agent that it spawned: what `$.session.messages({ agentId })` reads and its `turn.complete` carries. | Type: `string`. Optional. Known while the session tracks the run. Absent on other tools and on a refused Agent call. |
| `durationMs` | <Documented /> | On an answered Agent tool use that ran to completion, it is how long the agent ran. The unit is milliseconds, as the stored record of the call has it. | Type: `number`. Optional. Absent while it runs, on a background launch, and on every other tool. |
| `meta` | <Documented /> | What the MCP server of the tool addressed to plugins in `_meta`: entries under `"claude/plugins"` and `"anthropic/sources"`. The model never reads it. The engine leaves out a key over 256 KiB. | Type: `Record<string, unknown>`. Optional. Off by default. Absent on an error result, and when the server addressed nothing. A subagent's transcript keeps at most 8 KiB. |
