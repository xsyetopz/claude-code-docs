title: Skills and Commands
description: What skills and slash commands are, where skill files live, how names clash, and how to turn skills on or off.

A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file. It teaches Claude how to do one task.
A slash command is a short action that you type, such as `/compact` or `/model`.
A skill also gives you a slash command. For example, `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` gives you `/deploy`.
The older `.claude/commands/` folder still works and acts like a skill.

## Example

This skill makes a `/summarize-diff` command. Only you can start it.

```text title=".claude/skills/summarize-diff/SKILL.md"
---
description: Summarize the uncommitted changes in plain words.
argument-hint: "[focus]"
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Bash(git diff *)
---

Run `git diff` and summarize the changes.
Focus on: $ARGUMENTS
```

Type `/summarize-diff tests` in the prompt. `$ARGUMENTS` becomes `tests`.

## Skill Locations

When two skills share a name, the one in the higher place wins.

| Place | Status | What it holds | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise `<managed dir>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | <Documented /> | Skills for all users on a machine. | Wins over personal and project skills of the same name. |
| Personal `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | <Documented /> | Skills for all your projects. | Wins over project skills. |
| Project `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | <Documented /> | Skills for one repository. | Loaded from the start folder and each parent up to the repository root. A linked worktree with no `.claude/skills` uses the main checkout (2.1.277 or later). |
| Nested `.claude/skills/` below the start folder | <Documented /> | Skills for a sub-project. | Loads when Claude first reads or edits a file there, or after `/add-dir <subdir>`. On a clash the nested skill is `/apps/web:deploy`. |
| `--add-dir` or `/add-dir` folder | <Documented /> | Skills, `commands/`, and `agents/` of another folder. | `permissions.additionalDirectories` grants file access only and loads none of these. Needs the `project` setting source. Since `2.1.309`, when another skill already has its name, the skill is offered as `<folder>:<name>` ([v2.1.309 release notes](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.309)). |
| Plugin `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | <Documented /> | Skills of a plugin. | The command name is `/<plugin>:<skill>`. A plugin root `SKILL.md` with no `skills/` folder loads as one skill. |
| Synced skills `~/.claude/skills/synced/` | <Documented /> | Skills turned on in your claude.ai account. | Downloaded in the background (2.1.273 or later). Checked about every 10 minutes while active and every 40 minutes while idle. Never uploaded. The name `anthropic-skills` is reserved. Needs a claude.ai sign-in. Not in bare mode or `--safe-mode`. |
| Trash `~/.claude/skills/.trash/` | <Documented /> | Removed synced skills. | A sweep removes entries after 30 days by default. |
| `<name>@skills-dir` plugin | <Documented /> | A plugin made by `claude plugin init` in `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`. | Loads with no install step. The marketplace name `skills-dir` is reserved. |
| MCP-served skill | <Undocumented /> | A skill that an MCP server serves. | Claude Code reads supporting files through MCP resources. The origin tag is `mcp`. |
| Skill `loadedFrom` values | <Undocumented /> | Internal origin tags. | Found: `skills`, `commands_DEPRECATED`, `plugin`, `bundled`, `syncedSkills`, `mcp`, `memoryStore`. |

## Name Resolution

| Rule | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clash order | <Documented /> | Picks the skill that `/name` runs. | Enterprise, then personal, then project. A skill replaces a bundled skill or a built-in command of the same name, but not its aliases. A skill wins over a `.claude/commands/` file. |
| Name from layout | <Documented /> | Sets the command name. | `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` is `/frontend:component`. Frontmatter `name` sets the name of a skill folder. A plugin `name` sets the last part. |
| Refused characters | <Documented /> | Protects the `/` menu. | Refused: zero-width, control, private-use, bidirectional, odd blank characters, `<`, and `>`. The debug log tag is `[names]`. |
| Name length | <Undocumented /> | Caps a frontmatter `name`. | Claude Code ignores a name over 256 characters. It gives a warning. |

## Custom Commands

| Item | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/commands/<name>.md` and `~/.claude/commands/` | <Documented /> | The old form of a skill. | Accepts the same frontmatter except `name` and `paths`. Subfolders become `:` parts. |
| Plugin `commands` map | <Documented /> | Commands from a plugin manifest. | Keys: `source` or `content`, `description`, `argumentHint`, `model`, `allowedTools`. |

## Loading and Controls

| Item | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live change detection | <Documented /> | Reloads `SKILL.md` text when it changes. | Not in bare mode. A new top-level skills folder needs `/reload-skills`. Changes to `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`, `agents/`, and `output-styles/` need `/reload-plugins`. |
| Skill listing budget | <Documented /> | Caps how much skill text goes into context. | The budget in characters is `floor(window * bytesPerToken * skillListingBudgetFraction)`, at least 1. The window defaults to 200,000 when unknown. `bytesPerToken` is 4 for Claude 3 to 4.6 models and 3 for newer ones. The fraction defaults to `0.01` and must be above 0 and at most 1. `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` sets a fixed count and wins. A line is `- name: description`, where the description is the `description`, then ` - ` and `when_to_use` if set. It is cut at `skillListingMaxDescChars` (default 1,536) characters, with `…` at the end. Lines are joined by a newline. Over budget, Claude Code logs a warning. It keeps bundled skills and name-only skills as they are. It sorts the other skills by a priority score, highest first. It keeps full descriptions while the budget allows, and gives the rest only the name (the program). |
| `--disable-slash-commands` | <Documented /> | Turns off all skills and commands. | A CLI flag. Its help text is "Disable all skills and commands" since `2.1.304`. |
| Setting `skillOverrides` | <Documented /> | Sets the visibility of each skill. | Values, from most visible to least: `on`, `name-only`, `user-invocable-only`, `off`. `name-only` lists the name with no description. `user-invocable-only` and `off` remove the skill from the model's listing. A managed or flag setting is read first, and the first source that has a value wins. The model gets a refusal for `off`, or for `user-invocable-only` when you did not type the command: `Skill <name> is disabled for model invocation in skillOverrides settings`. A skill with `disable-model-invocation: true` is also left out of the listing, and a call to it fails with the reason `disable_model_invocation`. A command that is not a skill gives `<name> is a UI command, not a skill` (or `built-in CLI command`) (the program). |
| Setting `disableBundledSkills` | <Documented /> | Removes bundled skills. | Same as `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS=1`. Built-in commands stay. See [Bundled Skills](bundled-skills.md#controls). |
| Setting `disableSkillShellExecution` | <Documented /> | Disables `` !`cmd` `` injection. | See [Substitutions](substitutions.md#shell-injection). |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_POLICY_SKILLS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_API_SKILL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL_PROPOSALS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL_ATTRIBUTION` | <Documented /> | Skill-related environment variables. | `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_API_SKILL` removes the `claude-api` skill (checked). `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_POLICY_SKILLS` skips skills from the managed folder (checked: the managed skill was listed, and the variable removed it). `CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL_PROPOSALS` enables skill proposals in cloud sessions. It has no visible effect locally. Claude Code removes `CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL_ATTRIBUTION` from the env of subprocesses. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL` disables the `claude-code` skill, which a plain `-p` run does not list. See [Environment Variables](../../configure/env-vars/index.md). |

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["You type <code>/name</code> or Claude picks a skill"] --> B[Find the skill by name and place]
    B --> C["Read <code>SKILL.md</code> and frontmatter"]
    C --> D[Fill arguments and variables]
    D --> E[Run shell injection blocks]
    E --> F{context is fork?}
    F -- yes --> G[Run in a subagent]
    F -- no --> H[Add the text to the conversation]
    H --> I[Grant allowed-tools for this turn]
```

Only the skill description sits in context until the skill runs.
After that the full text stays in the conversation.
See [Substitutions](substitutions.md#invocation-control) for what compaction keeps.
