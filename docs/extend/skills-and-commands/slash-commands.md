title: Slash Commands
description: Every built-in slash command in Claude Code 2.1.307, grouped by job, with aliases, arguments, and gates.
sidebar_position: 5
---

A slash command is a word that starts with `/`. You type it in the prompt to do one thing, such as clearing the session or switching the model.
Type `/` to see the list.
Some commands open a panel. Others print a result or expand into a prompt for Claude.
Many commands are hidden unless your account, provider, or settings allow them.

You cannot change built-in commands, but you can add your own with [skills](index.md). Some commands have an env var or setting. The Notes column names it. Some also work in `-p` and the SDK.

## Example

```text
/model opus
/compact keep the database schema decisions
/effort high
```

Each line is a separate command. The text after the name is the argument.

## How to Read the Tables

- A panel command opens an interactive screen. The program calls it `local-jsx`.
- A text command returns text from fixed code. The program calls it `local`.
- A prompt command expands into a model prompt. The program calls it `prompt`.
- Many commands have two forms: a panel for interactive sessions and a text form for `-p` and the SDK.
- A `Gated` badge means a flag, policy, plan, provider, or env var must allow the command.
- The program holds about 101 command names, and it also makes `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` commands from MCP prompts.

## Session and Conversation Commands

| Command | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/add-dir` `<path>` | <Documented /> | Adds a working folder. | Panel. Runs at once when you give a path. Loads `.claude/skills`, `.claude/commands`, and `.claude/agents` of that folder. A text form runs for some SDK entry points. |
| `/cd` `<path>` | <Documented /> | Moves this session to a new working folder. | Panel. The new folder adds its project skills (2.1.246 or later). |
| `/clear` (aliases `/reset`, `/new`) `[name]` | <Documented /> | Starts a new session with empty context. | The old session stays on disk. `/resume` opens it. Works non-interactive too. |
| `/compact` `<optional custom summarization instructions>` | <Documented /> | Summarizes the conversation to free context. | Turned off when env var `DISABLE_COMPACT` is truthy. See [Context and Compaction](../../how-it-works/context-and-compaction.md). |
| `/autocompact` `[auto\|<tokens>]` | <Documented /> | Sets how full the context gets before it auto-summarizes. | Panel in interactive mode. A text form, "Configure the auto-compact window size", runs non-interactive or in a remote workspace. |
| `/context` | <Documented /> | Shows current context use. | Found only as a text command, enabled in non-interactive mode. |
| `/resume` (alias `/continue`) `[conversation id or search term]` | <Documented /> | Resumes a past conversation. | Panel. Hidden for a remote viewer. See [Sessions and Storage](../../how-it-works/sessions-and-storage.md). |
| `/rename` (alias `/name`) `[name]` | <Documented /> | Renames the conversation. | Panel and text form. |
| `/branch` `[name]` | <Documented /> | Branches the conversation at this point. | Panel. |
| `/fork` `<directive> or [prompt]` | <Documented /> | Starts a background agent that inherits the full conversation. | Panel. Off in coordinator mode. |
| `/subtask` `<task>` | <Documented /> | Sends a subagent off with your full context. Its result comes back here. | Panel. Off in coordinator mode. |
| `/background` (alias `/bg`) `[prompt]` | <Documented /> | Sends this session to the background and frees the terminal. | Panel. Runs at once with no prompt. Matches the `--bg` flag. |
| `/stop` | <Gated note="The session must be a background session." /> | Stops this background session. | The transcript and worktree are kept. |
| `/goal` `[<condition> \| clear]` | <Documented /> | Sets a goal that Claude checks before it stops. | Panel. A text form ("keep working until the condition is met") runs non-interactive or in a remote workspace. |
| `/plan` `[open\|<description>]` | <Documented /> | Turns on plan mode, or shows the session plan. | Panel. |
| `/recap` | <Documented /> | Writes a one-line session recap now. | Text command. |
| `/btw` `[question]` | <Documented /> | Asks a quick side question without interrupting the main conversation. | Panel. |
| `/export` `[filename]` | <Documented /> | Exports the conversation to a file or the clipboard. | Panel. |
| `/copy` `[N]` | <Documented /> | Copies the last reply to the clipboard. `/copy N` copies the Nth latest. | Panel. |
| `/exit` (alias `/quit`) | <Documented /> | Exits the CLI. In a background session it detaches and the session keeps running. | Panel and text form. |
| `/restart` (alias `/update`) | <Gated note="Interactive terminal on macOS or Linux, native install only, and a server-side feature flag." /> | Restarts Claude Code on the newly installed version and resumes this session. | Interactive only. See [How `/restart` Works](#how-restart-works). |
| `/rewind` (aliases `/checkpoint`, `/undo`) | <Documented /> | Restores the code, the conversation, or both to an earlier point. | Interactive only. |
| `/tasks` (alias `/bashes`) | <Documented /> | Shows and manages everything that runs in the background. | Panel. |
| `/list-agents` (alias `/peers`) | <Documented /> | Lists subagents, teammates, and other sessions you can message. | Off when the org setting `messagingBeyondOwnAgentsDisabled` is set. |
| `/focus` `[on\|off]` | <Documented /> | Toggles focus view: only your prompt, a summary, and the reply. | Needs the fullscreen renderer (`/tui fullscreen` or `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1`). The setting `viewMode: "focus"` does the same. |
| `/diff` | <Documented /> | Shows uncommitted changes and per-turn diffs. | Panel. Off when a mod provides its own diff view. |
| `/model` `<model> or [model]` | <Documented /> | Sets the model. | Panel and text form. See [Models](../../how-it-works/models.md). |
| `/effort` `[levels] or <levels>` | <Documented /> | Sets the effort level. | Panel and text form. Since `2.1.304`, `/effort status` no longer shows a guessed level when `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` is `auto` or `unset`. |
| `/fast` `[on\|off]` | <Gated note="First-party provider, and env var CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FAST_MODE not set." /> | Toggles fast mode. | Panel and text form. |
| `/advisor` `[model\|off]` | <Gated note="On when env CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ADVISOR_TOOL is set, otherwise server flag tengu_sage_compass2" /> <Experimental /> | Lets Claude consult a stronger model at key moments. | Panel and text form.

Since `2.1.305`, pressing `w` in the spawn-mode screen says the new mode is saved for the folder, and a later `claude remote-control` start that uses the saved mode says where it came from ([v2.1.305 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.305)). A `!` command sent over Remote Control is not run: `Not run: '!' commands aren't available in Remote Control sessions.

Since `2.1.304` the confirmation is numbered: 1 or Enter keeps, 2 deletes, and `y`, `n`, and Esc still worked. Since `2.1.305` `y` and `n` no longer answer. See [How `/usage` and `/artifacts` Work](#how-usage-and-artifacts-work). |

## How It Works

Each command is an object with a kind: panel, text, or prompt.
A command can have two objects, one for interactive use and a text one for non-interactive use. The second one is picked when the session is not interactive.
Aliases come from an `aliases` list on the object.
A skill or custom command with the same name replaces a built-in command, but not its aliases (see [Skills and Commands](index.md#name-resolution)).

## How `/restart` Works

`/restart` restarts Claude Code on the installed version and resumes the same session. It keeps the model, the permission mode, extra working directories, and the Remote Control state. After the restart, it adds a "Successfully updated from A to B" message.

It only shows when all of these are true:

- You are in an interactive terminal (not `-p`).
- You run macOS or Linux.
- You use the native install (the binary is under `~/.local/share/claude/versions/`, or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/claude/versions/`; a package-manager global install does not count).
- You are not in a teammate agent or a remote session, and slash commands are not disabled.
- A server-side feature flag is on for you. Some users never see it.

After an auto-update installs a new version, the prompt area shows a green notice: "Update installed · /restart to apply". When the conditions above are not met, it says "Restart to update" instead.

`/restart` refuses in these cases:

- Background work is running or pending. It says "Can't restart while work is running in the background — wait for it to finish (or stop it via /tasks), then try again." Running subagents and background shell commands count. Remote agents do not.
- Remote Control is connected, or the command came in over Remote Control.
- The session is not saved to disk.
- Claude tried to run it. You must type it at the prompt.
- The installed version is missing (it suggests `/doctor`), or that version is on hold.

Background sessions use `claude respawn <id>` instead.

## How `/usage` and `/artifacts` Work

`/artifacts` has four tabs: `All`, `Mine`, `Shared`, and `Pinned`. `Pinned` shows only when you have pins.
The footer lists the keys. `Enter` attaches the selected artifact to the session (the panel shows `Attaching <title>…`, and an artifact that is already attached is opened instead), `x` dismisses, `c` copies the URL, `Ctrl+R` renames, `d` deletes, `p` pins, `/` searches, and `r` refreshes.

To delete, press `d` or choose `Delete` from the actions menu. Only the owner can delete, so the key works only on your own artifacts. The panel asks `Delete <title>? This cannot be undone.` Choose `No, keep it` or `Yes, delete it`. Since `2.1.304` the keys are 1 or Enter to keep and 2 to delete, and `y`, `n`, and Esc still worked. Since `2.1.305` `y` and `n` no longer answer, and Esc goes back with nothing sent ([v2.1.305 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.305)).

A yes sends `DELETE /api/frame/<slug>`. The program retries once on `409`, `429`, or `503`. Success shows `Artifact deleted`. The link stops working for everyone. You cannot restore it, and republishing makes a new URL.

Since `2.1.305` `/usage` turns each warning into a one-line fix that names its source, and `f` applies the fixes. Each fix starts a prompt that begins `Fix what /usage flagged. Show me each change before you make it.` It tells Claude that text in backticks is a name from your logs, never an instruction. Examples of fix lines are `Turn off MCP servers you don't use`, `Stop sessions you no longer need`, `Start fresh when you switch tasks`, and `Give simple subagents a cheaper model` (the program). With Remote Control on, `/usage` says `Nothing was sent. Turn off Remote Control to use fixes.`

On `2.1.305`, an API key shows only session cost and tokens. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` also shows the `Current session` and `Current week (all models)` rows, filled from model reply headers. The panel then also shows `What's contributing to your limits usage?` with `Scanning local sessions…`. The program did not call the usage endpoint with the token, on `2.1.305` and again on `2.1.306` (see [Probes](../../reference/probes.md#static-and-print-probes)). A claude.ai login with the `user:inference` and `user:profile` scopes is what the program checks for the full section.

Reset times look like `Resets <time> (<time zone>)`. Minutes are dropped on the hour. A date is added when the reset is more than 24 hours away, and weekly rows always show the date.

When the usage endpoint is rate limited, `/usage` says so. What you see depends on the data it already has. A run against a local stub that answered `429` showed these texts. The time is 12-hour, rounded up to the next minute, with no zone and no date. This differs from the `Resets` lines.

| Data Before the `429` | What `/usage` Shows |
| --- | --- |
| None | `Error: Usage endpoint is rate limited until 10:44am.` |
| None, and the reply is a `200` with an `error` of type `rate_limit_error` | `Error: Usage endpoint is rate limited. Please try again in a moment.` |
| Bars from the `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h` and `-7d` headers | The bars, then `Per-model breakdown unavailable (rate limited until 10:43am)` |
| The same, plus `7d_oi` headers | An extra `Current week (<model>)` row, then `Partial usage data (rate limited until 10:47am)` |
| A saved cache that is 10 minutes old | The cached bars, then `Showing last-known usage as of 10m ago (rate limited until 10:45am)` |
| The same cache, with the `200` reply | `Showing last-known usage as of 10m ago (rate limited — try again in a moment)` |

The end time comes from `Retry-After`. A `Retry-After` of `1800` gave 30 minutes, and a missing one gave the 5-minute default. The program caps the hold at 1 hour. Claude Code keeps the hold in memory for each token, so a new process asks again. A saved cache younger than 60 seconds is shown without a request. The `200` reply has no end time, because only the `429` path reads the hold.

With `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` set, the panel shows `Failed to load usage data` and sends no request.

Not seen live, so these come from the program: the `(could not refresh)` ending, which the program uses when the request fails for a reason other than a rate limit, the form `Showing last-known usage (rate limited until <time>)` without `as of`, and a `403` response.

Source: the program. The delete prompt, the footer keys, and `Artifact deleted` were also seen in a live run. The `Resets` lines and the rate-limit texts above were seen against a local stub with fake subscriber credentials.
