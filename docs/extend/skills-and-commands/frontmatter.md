title: Skill Frontmatter
description: Every key you can set at the top of a SKILL.md file, with rules for how Claude Code reads them.
sidebar_position: 2
---

The frontmatter is the block of keys at the top of a `SKILL.md` file.
It sets the name, the description, the tools the skill may use, and who may call it.
For example, `disable-model-invocation: true` makes a skill that only you can start.

Use `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable`, or the `skillOverrides` setting, to turn a skill off.

## Example

```text title=".claude/skills/review/SKILL.md"
---
name: review
description: Review the current branch for bugs.
when_to_use: Use when the user asks for a code review.
argument-hint: "[path]"
allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob
model: inherit
effort: high
context: fork
agent: general-purpose
paths:
  - "src/**"
---

Review the changes under $ARGUMENTS and list the bugs you find.
```

## Rules

- Claude Code reads the frontmatter only when the first line is `---`.
- A YAML error loads the skill with no fields. You see the warning `[skills] YAML frontmatter ... failed to parse and was ignored`.
- Keys are case exact. An unknown key is ignored with no error.
- Booleans accept `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `1`, and `0` in any case (2.1.218 or later).
- A top-level `PreToolUse` or `PermissionRequest` key outside `hooks` is an error. The skill then loads with no hooks and no `allowed-tools`.
- If `description` is missing, Claude Code uses the first line of the body. It removes heading marks and cuts the text at 100 characters.

## Keys

| Key | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | <Documented /> | The command name. | Defaults to the folder name. At most 256 characters. Skills and plugin skills only, not command files. |
| `description` | <Documented /> | Tells Claude when to use the skill. | Numbers and booleans become strings. Cut at 1,536 characters in the listing. |
| `when_to_use` | <Documented /> | More trigger text. | Added after `description`. Counts toward the 1,536 limit. The only key with an underscore. |
| `argument-hint` | <Documented /> | An autocomplete hint. | Text, for example `[issue-number]`. |
| `arguments` | <Documented /> | Names for `$name` placeholders. | A space-separated string or a YAML list. Names made only of digits are dropped. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | <Documented /> | Stops Claude from loading the skill by itself. | Also blocks preload into subagents and use by scheduled tasks. |
| `user-invocable` | <Documented /> | `false` hides the skill from the `/` menu. | Default `true`. |
| `allowed-tools` | <Documented /> | Tools allowed without a prompt for the turn. | A space or comma string, or a list. The grant clears at your next message. Ignored under `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` (2.1.282). Since 2.1.305, plugins that Claude Desktop mounts by path no longer keep their `allowed-tools` when your organization's managed settings set it ([v2.1.305 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.305)). `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` works in Bash rules. |
| `disallowed-tools` | <Documented /> | Removes tools while the skill is active. | The same format. The program also reads `disallowedTools`. |
| `model` | <Documented /> | The model for the turn. | `inherit` keeps the active model. A model outside `availableModels` is not used. With `context: fork` it sets the subagent model. |
| `effort` | <Differs note="Docs: low, medium, high, xhigh, max. The program also accepts an integer." /> | The effort level for the turn. | The program warns `Valid options: ... or an integer`. |
| `context` | <Documented /> | `fork` runs the skill in a subagent. | Any other value is ignored. |
| `agent` | <Documented /> | The subagent type for `context: fork`. | Default `general-purpose`. |
| `background` | <Documented /> | `false` waits for the forked result. | Default `true`. 2.1.218 or later. |
| `hooks` | <Documented /> | Hooks that start when the skill runs. | They last for the session. See [Hooks](../hooks/index.md). |
| `paths` | <Documented /> | A glob limit for automatic loading. | A trailing `/**` is removed. A list of only `**` means no limit. Skills only. |
| `shell` | <Documented /> | The shell for `` !`cmd` `` blocks. | `bash` or `powershell`. Other values warn and fall back to bash. |
| `metadata` | <Documented /> | A free map for your own tools. | Dropped when it is not a map. |
| `license` | <Documented /> | An Agent Skills spec field. | Accepted, no effect. |
| `compatibility` | <Documented /> | An Agent Skills spec field. | A string up to 500 characters. No effect. |
| `version` | <Documented /> | Skill version text. | Read as a string. Not in the docs key table. For skills and plugin commands. |
| `fallback` | <Documented /> | A boolean that the loader reads. | Parsed with the boolean rule above. |
| `created_by`, `improved_by` | <Undocumented /> | Mark a skill as made by the `dream-proposal` flow. | Only the value `dream-proposal` counts. The env var `CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL_PROPOSALS` exists. |
| `experimental` | <Documented /> <Experimental /> | A map whose key names are recorded. | Only the key names go into `declaredFields`. |

## Skill Discovery with Bash `cd`

Since `2.1.312`, Claude Code finds per-directory skills and `paths` skills after a Bash command moves the working directory deeper into the same git repository.
When a file is read or written, the program walks up from the file to a base directory and looks for `.claude/skills` on the way.
It also tests the `paths` globs of conditional skills against the file path, relative to that base.
The base is now the directory where the session started, when all of these are true:

- The working directory is not the directory where the session started.
- The working directory is inside that directory.
- Both directories are in the same git repository.

In any other case, the base is the working directory.
For a file outside the working directory, the program skips a `.claude/skills` folder that git ignores or that it cannot confirm.
Source: the program (`chunk-r5cyd28m.js` lines 156298 to 156312 and 156113 to 156170).

## Outside Claude Code

claude.ai uploads and the Skills API accept only `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, and `allowed-tools`.
Other keys fail the upload.

## Exact Fields

The exact fields: the `skill` definition in `https://xsyetopz.github.io/clawdipedia/schemas/claude-code-frontmatter.json`, made from the program's frontmatter validators.
It lists every field of this release, so build on the fields it names and look each one up there before you rely on it.
