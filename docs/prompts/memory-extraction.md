This is the verbatim text that Claude Code 2.1.310 uses for the memory extraction subagent.

## Where It Comes From

This is the short opening of the prompt. The rest of the text is built elsewhere in the program, so only this part is shown. It has an `${e}` placeholder that is not filled in.

## How to Override It

No override found. We did not find a way to change this text. See [Override a Prompt](./override.md).

## Full Text
