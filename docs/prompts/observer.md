This is the verbatim text that Claude Code 2.1.310 uses for experimental observer agents.

## Where It Comes From

The program splits this string in the binary. The text here is the part we could read, so it may be incomplete. Observer agents are behind `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_OBSERVER_AGENTS`.

## How to Override It

The base text is fixed. Add your own text with the `observerMessage` field in a custom agent file. That text is added to the observer digest. See [Override a Prompt](./override.md).
