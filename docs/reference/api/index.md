description: How Claude Code talks to the model server, which endpoints, headers, and betas it uses, and what a proxy must pass on.

Claude Code is a client of the Messages API. It sends model requests, counts tokens, and calls a few account and service servers.
Each request carries headers and a list of beta values. This section lists them all.
If you run Claude Code behind a gateway or proxy, read these pages first, because the gateway must pass some headers on without a change.

## Pages

| Page | What It Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Endpoints and Headers](endpoints.md) | Model and service paths, request and response headers, the attribution block |
| [Betas](betas.md) | Every `anthropic-beta` value, when it is sent, and how the list is built |

## Example

Send Claude Code through a gateway and pass an extra header.

```bash title="Use a gateway"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://gateway.example.com
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS=$'X-Team: docs\nX-Env: staging'
claude
```
