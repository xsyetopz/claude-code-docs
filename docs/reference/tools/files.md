title: Files, Search, and Memory
description: Every parameter of Read, Write, Edit, NotebookEdit, Glob, Grep, LSP, and the memory tools.
sidebar_position: 2

These tools read, write, and search files, and they store memory notes.
Use `Read` before `Edit`, because `Edit` replaces an exact string in a file.
For example, `Grep` with `output_mode` set to `files_with_matches` lists only the files that match.
[Tools](index.md#how-to-read-the-tool-tables) explains the Yes and No columns.

You can also read or edit files yourself and let Claude see the result. Deny the tool name in `permissions.deny`, or leave it out of a subagent `tools` list, to turn a tool off. The memory tools need a server-side flag.

## Tools

Source: [Tools Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference), [Configure Permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions), and the program (the tool input schemas).

| Tool | Status | What It Does | How It Works | Available In | Read-Only | Parallel | Deferred |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Read` | <Documented /> | Reads files, images, PDFs, and notebooks. | See [Read Parameters](#read-parameters). | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `Write` | <Documented /> | Creates or overwrites a file. | `file_path` (string, required, absolute), `content` (string, required), `machine` (optional). A deny rule wins. | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `Edit` | <Documented /> | Replaces an exact string in a file. | `file_path` (required), `old_string` (required), `new_string` (required, must differ), `replace_all` (boolean, default false), `machine` (optional). | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `NotebookEdit` | <Documented /> | Edits a cell of a Jupyter notebook. | See [NotebookEdit Parameters](#notebookedit-parameters). | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `Glob` | <Documented /> | Finds files by glob pattern. | `pattern` (string, required), `path` (string, optional, directory), `machine` (optional). | Main session and subagents. The docs say a subagent can get `Glob` and `Grep` when the main session lacks them (macOS, Linux, WSL). | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `Grep` | <Documented /> | Searches file contents with ripgrep. | See [Grep Parameters](#grep-parameters). | Same as `Glob`. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `LSP` | <Documented /> | Code intelligence: definitions, references, symbols, hover, call hierarchy. | `operation`, `filePath` (required), `line` (int, 1 or more, required), `character` (int, 1 or more, required), `query` (optional, `workspaceSymbol` only). | Main session and subagents. Background subagents keep it since `2.1.280`. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `memory_read` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="hidden server-side flag" /> | Reads a document from a memory store. | `store` (string, required), `path` (string, required). | Only when auto memory is on (`autoMemoryEnabled`, no `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY`) and the memory mode is `tools`. The mode is `tools` when the server flag `tengu_linen_orbit` is on (default off) or organization memory is not closed. Organization memory needs the server flag `tengu_haze_glass`, no `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ORG_MEMORY` or `CLAUDE_MEMORY_STORES`, and the `allow_memory_sync` policy. The mode stays `files` in cloud sessions that set `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_MEMORY_DIR`, and when you set `CLAUDE_COWORK_MEMORY_GUIDELINES`. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `memory_write` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="hidden server-side flag" /> | Saves a document to a memory store. | `store`, `path`, `content` (all strings, required), `if_version` (string, max 64, version token for compare-and-set). `content` replaces the whole document. | Only when auto memory is on (`autoMemoryEnabled`, no `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY`) and the memory mode is `tools`. The mode is `tools` when the server flag `tengu_linen_orbit` is on (default off) or organization memory is not closed. Organization memory needs the server flag `tengu_haze_glass`, no `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ORG_MEMORY` or `CLAUDE_MEMORY_STORES`, and the `allow_memory_sync` policy. The mode stays `files` in cloud sessions that set `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_MEMORY_DIR`, and when you set `CLAUDE_COWORK_MEMORY_GUIDELINES`. | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `memory_list` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="hidden server-side flag" /> | Lists memory stores and their documents. | `store` (optional), `path_prefix` (optional, directory-aligned), `cursor` (optional). | Only when auto memory is on (`autoMemoryEnabled`, no `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY`) and the memory mode is `tools`. The mode is `tools` when the server flag `tengu_linen_orbit` is on (default off) or organization memory is not closed. Organization memory needs the server flag `tengu_haze_glass`, no `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ORG_MEMORY` or `CLAUDE_MEMORY_STORES`, and the `allow_memory_sync` policy. The mode stays `files` in cloud sessions that set `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_MEMORY_DIR`, and when you set `CLAUDE_COWORK_MEMORY_GUIDELINES`. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Example

Block reads of secret files and all edits to lock files.

```json title=".claude/settings.json"
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["Read(./.env)", "Read(./secrets/**)", "Edit(./package-lock.json)"]
  }
}
```

## How It Works

- `machine` is an extra optional field that Claude Code adds to a tool schema when an attached-machines feature is on.
- File tools check permissions with the rule syntax in [Permission Rules](../../configure/permissions/rules.md).
- `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Write`, and `Edit` carry `remoteExecution` metadata in the program. It marks them as runnable on a remote host.
- In a `--restricted` session, a file outside the working directories is refused for a file reference or an upload, even when a `Read` allow rule covers it. Before 2.1.316 such a rule could open the file for an upload (the program, and the 2.1.316 release notes).
- `Read` has no result size cap. So use `offset` and `limit` for large files.

## Write and Edit Limits

| Item | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `permissions.blockWritesOutsideWorkingDirectories` | <Documented /> | `Write`, `Edit`, and `NotebookEdit` refuse a path outside the working directories in every permission mode. | No allow rule lifts it. The setting also refuses a write to a Claude Code settings file inside the working directories. It removes `EnterWorktree` and `ExitWorktree` from the tools on offer. It does not limit shell commands, MCP tools, the programs that hooks run, or the memory tools. See [Permission Rules](../../configure/permissions/rules.md). |
| Server-managed settings | <Undocumented /> | `Write` and `Edit` ask before they change the local copy of your organization's server-managed settings. | They ask in the same way for a user settings file. See [Settings](../../configure/settings/index.md). |

## Write on a File That Claude Read Only in Part

Since `2.1.312`, `Write` refuses to overwrite some very large instruction files.
The files are a `CLAUDE.md` file, a rules file, or an `@`-included file that Claude Code loads for a subdirectory.

| Item | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Size test | <Gated note="Server flag tengu_quizzical_mango, on by default" /> | Claude Code cuts a loaded file when its text is longer than a limit. It adds the line `Only the start of this file is shown.` and marks the file as read in part. | The limit is the larger of 40,000 characters and 5% of the model context window, scaled by the bytes per token of the model. A managed file is never cut. |
| `Write` refusal | <Undocumented /> | While the mark holds, `Write` on the file fails with error code 19. | The message says that Claude has only the start of the file. A `Write` could lose the rest. It tells Claude to use `Edit` to change part of it. To replace the file, Claude must first `Read` it in one call with no `offset` or `limit`. |
| Clear the mark | <Undocumented /> | A `Read` of the whole file removes the refusal. | The program tests that the stored view holds the whole file and began at line 1. |

Source: the program (`chunk-r5cyd28m.js` lines 164229 to 164274, 73050 to 73054, 9596 to 9609, and 77622; `chunk-s2tghjwy.js` line 4530; `chunk-b09ckz08.js` line 8515).

## Errors

Each row is a family of messages. The backticked text is the start that every message in the family shares. A row marked `Various` gathers the messages of one feature that do not share one start.

| Start of Message | Status | What It Means | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Various | <Undocumented /> | **File tools.** `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, or `NotebookEdit` refused a call. | A Read deny rule covers the file. Claude has not read it yet. It changed since Claude last read it. It is too large. It is a pipe or device. It is a symbolic link. It is not a valid image, PDF page, or notebook. The edit does not match (string not found, no change). A write failed after the file was truncated. |
| `read not allowed under` | <Undocumented /> | **File references and uploads.** The program refused to read a file that a file reference, a Chrome file upload, or the upload screen named. The text ends with the path. | `read not allowed under --restricted: ${path}` means a `--restricted` session found the file outside the working directories and no working-directory rule covers it. A Read allow rule does not open it in this mode (the program, 2.1.316). `read not allowed under permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories: ${path}` means that setting blocks the path, or the real path behind it. |
| `Refusing to read` | <Undocumented /> | **File import.** The gated `/import` command, which imports config from another AI coding agent ([Slash Commands](../../extend/skills-and-commands/slash-commands.md)), opened a file for a project-scope import and the opened handle is not a regular file. The text is `Refusing to read ${path}: it is not a regular file.` | The reader opens the path without following links. A file over `10485760` bytes (`IMPORT_MAX_FILE_BYTES`) fails with `file exceeds IMPORT_MAX_FILE_BYTES; refusing to load`. Source: the program (`chunk-t1y1g3sw.js`). |
