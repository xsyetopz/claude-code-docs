title: Shell, Web, and Background Tasks
description: Every parameter of Bash, PowerShell, Monitor, WebFetch, WebSearch, TaskStop, and GetTask.

These tools run shell commands, fetch web pages, search the web, and manage background tasks.
They reach outside the project, so permission rules and the sandbox matter most for them.
For example, `Bash` with `run_in_background` set to `true` starts a long command and returns at once.
[Tools](index.md#how-to-read-the-tool-tables) explains the Yes and No columns.

You approve or deny each call by rule or by prompt. The switches are `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_WEB_FETCH=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1`, or a deny rule. PowerShell, the WebFetch switch, and GetTask are gated.

| Tool | Status | What It Does | How It Works | Available In | Read-Only | Parallel | Deferred |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Bash` | <Documented /> | Runs a shell command. | See [Bash Parameters](#bash-parameters). | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `PowerShell` | <Documented /> <Gated note="CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL" /> | Runs a Windows PowerShell command. | Same parameters as `Bash`, but `command` is a PowerShell command and `description` has a shorter text. | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `Monitor` | <Documented /> | Streams the output of a background command or a WebSocket as notifications. | See [Monitor Parameters](#monitor-parameters). | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `WebFetch` | <Documented /> <Gated note="CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_WEB_FETCH=1 turns it off" /> | Fetches a URL and applies a prompt to the page text. | `url` (URL string, required), `prompt` (string, required), `offset` (int, 0 or more, optional, character offset for a long page). The off switch needs `2.1.285` or later. | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `WebSearch` | <Documented /> <Gated note="off for the gateway provider. Vertex depends on the model" /> | Searches the web. | `query` (string, at least 2 characters, required), `allowed_domains` (string array, optional), `blocked_domains` (string array, optional). | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `TaskStop` | <Documented /> | Stops a running background task. | `task_id` (string, optional). It also takes a teammate or named background agent by ID or name. `shell_id` (string, optional, deprecated). | Main session and subagents. Kept in background subagents. | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `GetTask` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="hidden server-side flag" /> | Checks a background shell command by task ID. | `taskId` (string, required). | Only when the server flag `tengu_violin_rosin` is on (default off). Nothing local turns it on. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS`, the setting that turns off background tasks, and `--bare` turn it off. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## `Bash` Parameters

| Parameter | What It Does | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | The shell command to run. | ✅ |
| `timeout` | Time limit in milliseconds for a foreground command. | ❌ |
| `description` | A short note on what the command does. | ❌ |
| `run_in_background` | Starts the command as a background task and returns at once. | ❌ |
| `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` | Runs the command without the sandbox. | ❌ |
| `allowed_domains` | Network hosts that this command may reach. Offered only when the sandbox network lists are on. | ❌ |
| `machine` | Name of an attached machine to run the call on. Offered only when machines are attached. | ❌ |

`PowerShell` takes the same parameters, except that it has no `allowed_domains` unless the network lists are on.

## `Monitor` Parameters

| Parameter | What It Does | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | Short note on what the monitor watches. Notifications show it. | ✅ |
| `command` | Shell command whose output lines become notifications. | ❌ |
| `ws` | WebSocket target to stream. Give exactly one of `command` or `ws`. | ❌ |
| `timeout_ms` | Kills the monitor after this time. At least 1000, with a default and a cap. | ❌ |
| `persistent` | Runs until `TaskStop` or the end of the session, with no timeout. | ❌ |
| `allowed_domains` | Network hosts for a `command` monitor, offered only when the sandbox network lists are on. | ❌ |

## Example

Turn on the PowerShell tool and turn off web fetching for one project.

```json title=".claude/settings.json"
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL": "1",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_WEB_FETCH": "1"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

- Since `2.1.305`, when the disk is full, `Bash` does not start the command and says so: `The command was not started: this computer's disk is full (...), so the file that captures command output could not be created. Nothing ran. If this is the user's own computer, tell them before deleting anything to make room.` It no longer shows a raw `ENOSPC` file path ([v2.1.305 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.305); the program).
- Since `2.1.310`, `Monitor` and plugin monitors no longer wait for the server flag `tengu_amber_sentinel` (default off). So they also work on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry, and with telemetry or nonessential traffic off, where that flag could not load. On Windows, `Monitor` still needs Git Bash ([v2.1.310 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.310); the program).
- `Bash` refuses a command that starts with a `sleep` of 25 seconds or more, while background tasks and their completion notices are on. The `Bash` prompt then tells Claude to poll with `Monitor` and an until-loop. Since `2.1.310`, this also applies where `Monitor` is newly on (the program).
- Since `2.1.311`, a `Bash` or `PowerShell` result can carry `subagentCapApplied`, which is `true` or left out (`BashResult` and `PowerShellResult` in [`claude-code-tools.json`](../schemas.md)). The program sets it when the caller is not the main agent and the timeout it used is shorter than the one asked for. A subagent cap shortens the timeout only when the command can move to the background. A cap of 0 or less means no cap, and the shortened timeout is never below 2000 ms. The background notice then reads `Command was moved to the background (ID: ...) after running for Ns` and not `Command did not complete within its Ns timeout` (the program: `chunk-2ht8z368.js:240622`, `chunk-6e7t0570.js:5680`, `chunk-kh3xacwt.js:42`, `chunk-2ht8z368.js:152091`).
- Since `2.1.311`, when a `Bash` command runs past its timeout and moves to the background, the result holds the output so far, read from the task's output file, along with the notice `Command did not complete within its Ns timeout and was moved to the background (ID: ...)`. `2.1.310` has no such read (the program: `chunk-2ht8z368.js:240164`, `:236181`, `:152111`).
- A hook whose matcher names `Bash` also runs for a `Monitor` call that has a `command`. The program counts `Bash` as another name of `Monitor` for this. Such a hook can block the command or ask. A `permissionDecision` of `allow` is ignored, and `updatedInput` is dropped, so the hook cannot approve or rewrite the command. A `Monitor` call with `ws` is not covered (the program).
- When the server flag `tengu_swirling_koala` is on, the shell that `Bash` starts runs `unalias which` and `unset -f which` before your command, so an inherited `which` alias or function does not apply (the program).
- On macOS, `Bash` adds a `git` shell function that runs `git grep` with `LC_ALL=C`. The program adds it only when the command is under 1000 characters, holds only ASCII, and has no variable assignment before `git`. It skips the function when `git grep` has an option that starts with `--p`, `--op`, or `--textc`, or a short option that holds `O`, `P`, or `f`. It also does not replace a `git` alias or function that already exists. The reason for the C locale is not stated in the program (the program).
- The shell snapshot is a file that `Bash` sources before each command. Claude Code builds it from your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. Since `2.1.316`, for bash (the program):
  - A function whose name starts with `-` or `+` is written as `eval -- ...` and read with `declare -f -- name`, so `declare` does not take the name for an option. Other names keep the old rule, which skips names that start with one underscore and then a character that is not an underscore.
  - An alias is read with `\alias -p`, and only the line that starts with `alias` gets the `alias --` prefix. The lines of a value that holds line breaks stay whole. The zsh branch and the Git Bash (`msys` or `cygwin`) branch still prefix every line, and Git Bash also drops aliases of `winpty`. Every branch keeps the first `1000` lines.
  - The `set -o` step writes `set -o <name>` only for an option whose state is `on`, and for `monitor`. Version `2.1.314` wrote it for every line that held the text `on`, such as `onecmd off`. The release notes say that scripts started from `Bash` stopped after their first command when `SHELLOPTS` was exported ([v2.1.316 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.316)).
- Background subagents keep `Bash`, `PowerShell`, `Monitor`, `TaskStop`, `WebFetch`, and `WebSearch`. See [Create Custom Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents).
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1` also disables auto-backgrounding and the `Ctrl+B` key ([Environment Variables](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars)).
- A true value for `CLAUDE_AUTO_BACKGROUND_TASKS` gives the `Agent` tool a 120000 ms auto-background time. Source: the program (the env name). It is not in the saved docs. So it is <Undocumented />.

## Errors

Each row is a family of messages. The backticked text is the start that every message in the family shares. A row marked `Various` gathers the messages of one feature that do not share one start.

| Start of Message | Status | What It Means | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Various | <Undocumented /> | **Monitor.** `RunMonitorCommand` or a plugin monitor did not run a command. | A permission request or `monitor_input` does not match. The call sent no progress token. Another call changed the working directory. The environment already runs as many monitors as it allows. The same call was started before. A plugin monitor command references a value that a shell would parse. |
| Various | <Undocumented /> | **Shell and web tools.** A shell, search, or web tool call was refused. | A sed command is dangerous or has no arguments. A shell permission check failed or was interrupted for a pattern. A command contains an invisible character. Git Bash or PowerShell is not available. `WebFetch` cannot fetch localhost or a name with no dot. `ripgrep` was refused or failed. |
| Various | <Undocumented /> | **Built-in `gh api`.** The built-in `gh api` refused a call. | The endpoint, method, header, or field is not valid. `{owner}`, `{repo}`, or `{branch}` cannot be filled in. `--paginate` is used with a non-GET request. `--jq` needs `jq`. The session's GitHub proxy cannot set a header. Nonessential network traffic is disabled. |
