title: Transcript Format
description: The session JSONL file, where it lives, and every line type and field that Claude Code writes.
sidebar_position: 5
---

A transcript is a text file with one JSON object on each line.
Each object is a message, or a note about the session.
Claude Code appends a line as things happen, so a crash loses little.
The [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-directory) say the format is internal and changes between versions, so a script that reads it can break.

## At a Glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Can you use it? | ✅ Yes, read-only. Open the file with `jq` or any JSON Lines reader. |
| Can you change it? | Not safely. Claude Code owns the file. Use `/export` or print mode output for scripts. |
| Can you turn it on or off? | `--no-session-persistence` (print mode) or `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY` (any mode). |
| Where does it live? | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl` |
| Status | <Documented /> for the location. <Undocumented /> for every line type and field. |

## Where Files Live

Source: [Explore the .claude Directory: Application Data](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-directory#application-data).

<FileTree>

- `~/.claude/`
  - `history.jsonl` every prompt you typed
  - `projects/`
    - `<project>/`
      - `<session>.jsonl` the transcript
      - `<session>.orphaned-<time>-<id>.jsonl` set aside, not in the picker
      - `<session>.jsonl.superseded-<time>` set aside, not in the picker
      - `<session>/`
        - `subagents/` one transcript per subagent
        - `tool-results/` large tool outputs and MCP images

</FileTree>

The `<project>` name is the folder path with every character other than a letter or a digit changed to `-`.
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` moves `~/.claude`. See [Sessions and Storage](../how-it-works/sessions-and-storage.md) for cleanup and resume rules.

## How the Lines Link

Most lines carry `uuid` and `parentUuid`. The `parentUuid` field points to the line before, so the lines form a chain.
A branch or a rewind makes a second child for one parent. The `last-prompt` line holds a `leafUuid` that marks the tip the picker uses.

## Common Fields

These keys appear on `user`, `assistant`, `attachment`, and `system` lines.

| Field | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | <Undocumented /> | The line type (see the next section). |
| `uuid` | <Undocumented /> | ID of the line. The same in the file and in every later read. |
| `parentUuid` | <Undocumented /> | `uuid` of the line before. `null` for the first line. |
| `sessionId` | <Undocumented /> | The session ID. Also written as `session_id` on some lines. |
| `timestamp` | <Undocumented /> | When Claude Code wrote the line, in ISO form. |
| `cwd` | <Undocumented /> | The working folder. |
| `gitBranch` | <Undocumented /> | The git branch at the time, if any. |
| `version` | <Undocumented /> | The Claude Code version that wrote the line. |
| `entrypoint` | <Undocumented /> | The host that started the session, such as `cli` or `sdk-cli`. See [Architecture](../how-it-works/architecture.md#where-it-runs). |
| `userType` | <Undocumented /> | The kind of user account. |
| `isSidechain` | <Undocumented /> | `true` on lines that belong to a subagent branch. |
| `isMeta` | <Undocumented /> | `true` on a user-side row the person did not type, such as a reminder. |

## Line Types

All rows are <Undocumented />, because no docs page lists the line types.
The key lists come from transcripts that 2.1.305 wrote on a real machine and in a stub run, and the meanings from the program and its type file where they are clear.

| `type` | Main keys | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user` | `message`, `promptId`, `permissionMode`, `permissionDecision`, `toolUseResult`, `sourceToolAssistantUUID`, `origin`, `promptSource`, `turnOrigin`, `turnPosition`, `sandboxed` | A user turn or a tool result. Since `2.1.307` a shell tool result can carry `sandboxed`, whether the command ran in the sandbox (the program, and probe `print.transcripts.lines`). |
| `assistant` | `message`, `requestId`, `requestRef`, `requestedModel`, `effort`, `perTurnEffort`, `advisorModel`, `apiBlockIndex` | A reply of the model. |
| `system` | `subtype`, `content`, `level`, `durationMs`, `messageCount` | A note that the model never reads. |
| `attachment` | `attachment`, `rendered`, `renderedRole`, `renderedInHumanTurn`, `renderedBesideToolResult` | Context that Claude Code adds beside the conversation. `rendered` is the text the model sees and `renderedRole` is `user` or `system`. `renderedBesideToolResult` is `true` on a `remote_session_change` attachment, and `renderedInHumanTurn` is on a `queued_command` attachment whose text differs inside a human turn (the program). |
| `queue-operation` | `operation`, `content`, `commandUuid`, `deliveryId`, `reason` | A prompt or command that waits in the queue. |
| `api-request` | `params`, `shapeHash`, `cacheControl`, `requestDigest`, `querySource`, `base`, `keep`, `tail`, `id` | The shape of one request. |
| `api-request-shape` | `shape`, `shapeHash` | The `system` and `tools` of a request, stored once. |
| `api-request-blob` | `hash`, `message` | A message stored by its hash. |
| `file-history-snapshot` | `messageId`, `snapshot`, `isSnapshotUpdate` | A file checkpoint for rewind. |
| `file-history-delta` | `messageId`, `snapshotMessageId`, `backup`, `trackingPath` | A change to a checkpoint. |
| `last-prompt` | `lastPrompt`, `leafUuid` | The last prompt, for the picker. |
| `ai-title` | `aiTitle` | The title that the model made for the session. |
| `mode` | `mode` | The mode of the session. Seen value: `normal`. |
| `permission-mode` | `permissionMode` | The permission mode. Seen value: `auto`. |
| `cost-state` | `totalCostUSD`, `totalAPIDuration`, `totalAPIDurationWithoutRetries`, `totalToolDuration`, `totalDuration`, `totalLinesAdded`, `totalLinesRemoved`, `modelUsage`, `hasUnknownModelCost`, `startTime` | Totals for cost and time. Since `2.1.311`, each `modelUsage` entry also has `cacheCreationEphemeral5mInputTokens` and `cacheCreationEphemeral1hInputTokens` (see [Stream JSON Messages](../extend/headless/stream-json.md#fields-new-in-21311)). |
| `atis-latch` | `atis` | The `atis` value of the session's feature-flag client, kept once per conversation so it stays the same, and sent as the `x-cc-atis` header. Empty without a flag value (it was empty in our stub run). |

Lines of types `file-history-snapshot`, `file-history-delta`, `last-prompt`, `ai-title`, `mode`, `permission-mode`, `cost-state`, `atis-latch`, and `queue-operation` carry `sessionId` but not the chain fields.

### Other Types in the Writer

These names are in the program next to the writer. The meanings come from the writer and reader code (source: the program), not from example lines.

| `type` | Main keys | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `custom-title` | `customTitle` | The title you set, for example with `/rename`. |
| `agent-name`, `agent-color` | | The name and color of the session's agent. Set by `/rename`, `/color`, or an agent. |
| `agent-setting` | | The agent definition that the session runs as, for example from `--agent`. |
| `tag` | `tag` | A tag on the session. |
| `worktree-state` | `worktreeSession` | The worktree that the session works in. `null` after it ends. |
| `pr-link` | `prNumber`, `prUrl`, `prRepository`, `timestamp` | Ties the session to a pull request. |
| `bridge-session` | `bridgeSessionId`, `lastSequenceNum`, `sessionGroupingId`, owner ids | The Remote Control link. |
| `content-replacement` | `replacements`, `agentId` | Records which large tool results were replaced by a short stand-in, so a resume uses the same stand-ins. |
| `attribution-snapshot` | `messageId` | A snapshot of file-contribution data for commits. On load the program keeps only the last one and trims a large one. In `2.1.312` the program exports its writer function and no code calls it, so only older sessions hold these lines (the program). |
| `fork-context-ref` | `agentId`, `parentSessionId`, `parentLastUuid`, `contextLength` | A forked agent's pointer to its parent. The fork reads the parent's lines and does not copy them. |
| `observer-ref` | `observerTaskId`, `observerAgentType`, `agentId`, `timestamp` | An observer agent's pointer. |
| `progress` | `toolUseID`, `parentToolUseID`, `data` | Progress of a running tool, hook, skill, or agent. `data.type` is `hook_progress`, `tool_heartbeat`, `bash_progress`, `powershell_progress`, `agent_progress`, `agent_api_retry`, `skill_progress`, `search_results_received`, `query_update`, `workflow_log`, `workflow_phase`, `workflow_agent`, or `artifact_publish_retry`. |
| `isolation-latch` | `side` | Records a one-time choice about where the session runs, kept for resume. |
| `memory-mode` | `mode`, `afterUuid`, `reason`, `account` | A stamp that auto memory switched mode. One per switch. |
| `dev-mods` | `folder` | The folder of a mod under development that the session uses. |
| `frame-link` | `path`, `frameUrl`, `title`, `artifactCount` | A link from the session to an artifact page. |
| `ended-by-model` | `timestamp` | Marks that the model ended the session. |
| `line-withheld` | `bytes` | Not a stored type. A line that could not be read or was too large is swapped for `{"type":"line-withheld","bytes":N}` when a transcript is uploaded. |
| `artifact-autoreact-ledger` | `artifacts`, `accountUuid`, `v` | Bookkeeping for automatic replies to artifact comments. |
| `relocated` | `relocatedCwd` | The working folder was moved. |
| `summary` | `leafUuid`, `summary` | A summary line. The program reads these lines on load, and no code in `2.1.312` writes them, so only older sessions hold them. |
| `continued-in` | `continuedInSessionId` | Points to the session that continued this one. |
| `history-suppression`, `artifact-comment-monitor` | | Also in the program's table. No further meaning was read. |

`proactivity` and `language` are not line types. They are kinds of `attachment` (`attachment.type`). `proactivity` carries `status`, `level`, and `tools`. `language` carries the reply `language`.

On resume the program applies a replay policy to each type. Unknown types add up.

- Last line wins: most types in the lists above, including `atis-latch`.
- Add up: `content-replacement`, `fork-context-ref`, `frame-link`, `artifact-comment-monitor`, and `memory-mode`.
- Dropped at a compact boundary: `progress`, `file-history-snapshot`, `file-history-delta`, `last-prompt`, `continued-in`, `api-request-shape`, `api-request-blob`, and `api-request`.

## The `message` Object

On `user` and `assistant` lines, `message` holds an API message.

| Field | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `role` | both | `user` or `assistant`. |
| `content` | both | A string (a typed prompt), or an array of blocks. |
| `id`, `model`, `type` | assistant | The API message ID, the model that answered, and `message`. |
| `stop_reason`, `stop_sequence`, `stop_details` | assistant | Why the model stopped. Seen values: `tool_use`, `end_turn`. |
| `usage` | assistant | Token counts (next table). |
| `container`, `context_management`, `diagnostics`, `input_transformations` | assistant | Extra fields of the API reply. |

Content block types seen: `text`, `thinking`, `tool_use` (in `assistant` lines), and `text`, `tool_result` (in `user` lines).

### The `usage` Object

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` | Tokens read and written. |
| `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens` | Tokens written to and read from the prompt cache. |
| `cache_creation` | A break-down of cache writes by lifetime. |
| `output_tokens_details`, `iterations` | More detail about output and about repeated passes. |
| `server_tool_use` | Counts of server-side tool calls. |
| `service_tier`, `speed`, `inference_geo` | The tier, the speed mode, and the region of the call. |
| `fallback_credit` | Present when a fallback model answered. |

## `user` Line Fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `promptId` | Groups the lines of one prompt. |
| `permissionMode` | The permission mode when the prompt was sent. |
| `permissionDecision` | On a tool result: an object with `decision` (seen: `accept`), `source` (seen: `config`), and `reasonType` (seen: `classifier`, `mode`). |
| `toolUseResult` | The structured result of a tool. Its keys depend on the tool. Seen: `stdout`, `stderr`, `interrupted`, `isImage` for `Bash`; `filePath`, `structuredPatch`, `originalFile`, `userModified` for edits; `agentId`, `status`, `outputFile`, `isAsync` for `Agent`. |
| `sourceToolAssistantUUID` | `uuid` of the assistant line whose `tool_use` this answers. |
| `origin` | Who caused the line. Seen kinds: `human`, `peer` (a subagent hand-back). |
| `promptSource` | How the prompt came in. Seen: `typed`. |
| `turnOrigin`, `turnPosition` | Where the turn came from and its place in the chain. |
| `queueSkipAttachments`, `queueSkipSlashCommands` | Set on queued prompts that skip those steps. |

## `assistant` Line Fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `requestId` | The request ID from the API. |
| `requestRef` | A reference to the matching `api-request` line. |
| `requestedModel` | The model Claude Code asked for. The `message.model` field shows the model that answered. |
| `effort`, `perTurnEffort` | The effort level of the call. Since `2.1.312`, `effort` is the level in force: if the conversation already holds an effort change that the model applied, the request uses that level, not a newly picked one. The program reads `effort` from `output_config.effort` of the request it built (`chunk-r5cyd28m.js` lines 135670 and 136924). In `2.1.311` it was built from the new pick (`chunk-2ht8z368.js` line 134537). |
| `advisorModel` | The advisor model, if the advisor tool was on. |
| `apiBlockIndex` | The index of this block in the API reply. One reply can produce several lines. |
| `thinkingDisplay`, `thinkingDurationMs` | How the thinking text was shown, and how long it took. |
| `serverClassifierRequest`, `wireToolInputs`, `wireIngestContext` | Internal fields about classifier calls and tool input on the wire. |

## `system` Subtypes

| `subtype` | Extra keys | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `turn_duration` | `durationMs`, `messageCount`, `pendingBackgroundAgentCount` | How long a turn took. |
| `local_command` | `content`, `level`, `commandRun` | The output of a local slash command. |
| `informational` | `content`, `level` | A notice for the user. |
| `compact_boundary` | (see [Context and Compaction](../how-it-works/context-and-compaction.md)) | Marks where a compaction replaced the history. |

## `attachment` Types

An `attachment` line holds an object in `attachment` with a `type` key.
Types seen in real 2.1.305 transcripts: `total_tokens_reminder`, `output_style`, `output_style_instructions`, `queued_command`, `edited_text_file`, `skill_listing`, `agent_listing_delta`, `deferred_tools_delta`, `deferred_tools_record`, `mcp_instructions_delta`, `environment`, `date`, `model`, `session_context`, `instructions`, `auto_mode`, `credential_org`, `prompt_snapshot`, `silent_turn_reminder`, `nested_memory`, and `file`. `goal_status` and `remote_session_change` were not seen there. A 2.1.305 stub run showed `total_tokens_reminder`, `output_style`, `output_style_instructions`, `nested_memory`, `skill_listing`, `agent_listing_delta`, `deferred_tools_delta`, `environment`, `date`, `model`, `session_context`, `instructions`, `auto_mode`, `prompt_snapshot`, and `remote_session_change`:

| `attachment.type` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `total_tokens_reminder` | A reminder of the token budget. |
| `output_style`, `output_style_instructions` | The active output style. |
| `queued_command` | A prompt that was queued while a turn ran. |
| `nested_memory` | A nested `CLAUDE.md` that was picked up. |
| `skill_listing` | The list of skills. |
| `agent_listing_delta`, `deferred_tools_delta`, `mcp_instructions_delta` | Changes to agents, deferred tools, or MCP instructions. |
| `deferred_tools_record` | A record of deferred tools. |
| `edited_text_file` | A note that a file changed outside the model. |
| `environment`, `date`, `model`, `session_context`, `instructions` | Environment and session facts. |
| `remote_session_change` | The commit and pull request attribution text for git, as a reminder to the model. |
| `goal_status`, `auto_mode`, `credential_org`, `prompt_snapshot`, `silent_turn_reminder` | State of a goal, auto mode, the account, the prompt snapshot, and a reminder after a silent turn. |

The Mod API type `SessionAppendMessage` lists the `name` of an attachment as `queued_command`, `nested_memory`, and similar, and notice names such as `compact_boundary` and `local_command`.

## `queue-operation` Values

The `operation` key was seen as `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `remove`. A `remove` line carries `reason`.

## File History Lines

A `file-history-snapshot` line holds `snapshot` with `messageId`, `timestamp`, and `trackedFileBackups`.
`/rewind` and `--rewind-files` use these to restore files. The newest 100 checkpoints are kept.

## `api-request` Lines

The `params` object of an `api-request` line has these keys: `model`, `max_tokens`, `thinking`, `output_config`, `context_management`, `safeguards`, and `betas`.
The `system` and `tools` parts are in a separate `api-request-shape` line with the same `shapeHash`.
Large messages are stored once in `api-request-blob` lines and referred to by hash. See [Request and Cache](../how-it-works/request-and-cache.md#body-fields).

## Example

Count the lines by `type` to see what a session holds:

```bash
jq -r .type ~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
```

List the tools the model called, in order:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.type=="assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type=="tool_use") | .name' \
  ~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl
```

:::warning
The file is plain text. A secret that a tool prints goes into it.
Set `cleanupPeriodDays` low, or `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY`, if that matters to you.
:::

## Exact Fields

The exact fields: `https://xsyetopz.github.io/clawdipedia/schemas/claude-code-transcript.json`, with one definition for each line `type`. The program builds this payload in code, not with a validator, so the schema is read from that code: a field marked `x-unverified` has a type the code does not show, and `x-observed` marks a field that a probe saw.
It lists every field of this release, so build on the fields it names and look each one up there before you rely on it.
