title: Auto Mode Default Rules
description: The default allow, hard deny, environment, and soft deny entries of the auto mode classifier, one row per rule.
sidebar_position: 6
---

These are the built-in entries of the [auto mode](auto-mode.md) classifier.
An `allow` entry is an exception to a block rule.
A `soft_deny` entry blocks an action unless an `allow` entry applies or you clearly asked for it.
For example, `Production Deploy` blocks a deploy to production until you ask for it by name.

## At a Glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Can you use it? | Yes. They apply whenever the permission mode is `auto`. |
| Can you change it? | Yes. Add or replace entries with the `autoMode` setting. Keep the defaults with `$defaults`. |
| Can you turn it on or off? | Drop `$defaults` from a list to remove the built-in entries of that list. |
| Where does it live? | Inside the program. `claude auto-mode defaults` prints them as JSON. |
| Status | <Documented /> <Undocumented /> |

## Example

```bash
claude auto-mode defaults --label "Production Deploy"
```

This prints the full text of one rule. `--label` matches the start of a label, without regard to case.
In the JSON, some labels end in `[named+specifics ...]`. For those rules, your request must name the listed item to count as direction.

Rule summaries below are short. Official page: [Configure Auto Mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/auto-mode-config). Rules marked <Undocumented /> come from `claude auto-mode defaults`.

## Allow Rules

Each `allow` rule is an exception to the soft deny rules.

| Rule | Status | What it allows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Security Discussion` | <Undocumented /> | Reading, reviewing, or writing security code and threat models is fine as part of your task. |
| `Transient Retry` | <Undocumented /> | Retrying an action after a network error, timeout, or rate limit is not a bypass. |
| `Test Artifacts` | <Documented /> | Fake test keys, placeholder credentials, and hardcoded test cases are fine. |
| `Local Operations` | <Undocumented /> | Deleting or changing local files inside the project is fine. |
| `Read-Only Operations` | <Undocumented /> | `GET` requests and queries that change nothing and return no secrets are fine. |
| `Declared Dependencies` | <Undocumented /> | Installing packages that the repo manifest already lists is fine. |
| `Toolchain Bootstrap` | <Undocumented /> | Installing a language toolchain from its official one-line installer is fine when the repo needs it. |
| `Standard Credentials` | <Undocumented /> | Reading a credential from the agent config and sending it to its own provider is fine. |
| `Session-Created Job Cleanup` | <Undocumented /> | Deleting the jobs that the agent itself made in this session is fine. |
| `Git Push Destination` | <Undocumented /> | Pushing to any branch of the session repo is normal, also the default branch. |
| `Trusted Internal Infra (Data Flow)` | <Undocumented /> | Domains, buckets, and services in `Environment` count as internal, not external. |
| `Scheduled-Task Fires` | <Undocumented /> | A scheduled-task prompt is not a live human instruction. |
| `Multi-Agent Coordination` | <Undocumented /> | Messages between teammates and subagents are normal traffic. |
| `Memory Directory` | <Undocumented /> | Routine writes to and deletes from the memory directory are fine. |
| `CLAUDE.md Content` | <Undocumented /> | Editing `CLAUDE.md` is fine when the text does not change permissions or auto mode. |
| `Claude Code Scheduling` | <Undocumented /> | Using `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`, `CronList`, or `RemoteTrigger` to schedule tasks is fine. |
| `Browser Trusted Navigation` | <Undocumented /> | Navigating the browser to a trusted domain, `localhost`, or a URL you named is fine. |

## Hard Deny Rule

| Rule | Status | What it blocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Data Exfiltration` | <Documented /> | Sending sensitive data across the trust boundary is always blocked, even when you ask for it. |

A scoped exception sends commits and pushes of sensitive material to the `Sensitive-Source Provenance` soft rule when that rule exists.
