description: Every keybinding context and action of Claude Code, with the default keys, and how to change them in keybindings.json.

Claude Code reads your keyboard shortcuts from `~/.claude/keybindings.json`.
Each block names a context and maps key strokes to actions. A context is where the block applies.
This page lists the contexts, the default key of each action, and the actions that have no default key.

Run `/keybindings` to open the file.

Source: [Customize Keyboard Shortcuts](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings) and the program.
The tables below come from the default keys in the program.
An action marked <Undocumented /> is not named on the official page.

## Example

This file binds `ctrl+k` in the chat input to the stash action. It frees `ctrl+s` there. It runs `/compact` on `ctrl+shift+k`.

```json title="~/.claude/keybindings.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://xsyetopz.github.io/clawdipedia/schemas/claude-code-keybindings.json",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "context": "Chat",
      "bindings": {
        "ctrl+k": "chat:stash",
        "ctrl+s": null,
        "ctrl+shift+k": "command:compact"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A binding value is an action name, `command:<name>`, or `null`. `command:<name>` runs the slash command as if you typed it. `null` removes a default key.
The `command:` name may use letters, digits, `:`, `-`, and `_`.
The schema is [claude-code-keybindings.json](https://xsyetopz.github.io/clawdipedia/schemas/claude-code-keybindings.json).
