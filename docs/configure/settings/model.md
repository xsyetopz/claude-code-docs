description: Keys that choose the model, the effort level, thinking, fast mode, cache lifetime, and model allow and block lists.

These keys choose the model Claude Code uses and how hard it thinks.
Administrators also use them to allow or block models.
Several keys have a matching environment variable that wins over the key.

Use `/model` or edit a settings file. `fastMode`, `alwaysThinkingEnabled`, and `enforceAvailableModels` switch features.

## Keys

Source: [Settings Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings-reference) for rows marked <Documented />. For rows marked <Undocumented />, Source: the program (its bundled settings schema).
Where to Set It tells you which files may set the key. See [Settings Files and Scopes](index.md#where-settings-live).

| Key | Status | Type | Default | What It Does | Where to Set It |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `advisorModel` | <Documented /> | string | - | Pick which model answers when Claude asks the advisor tool. | Any settings file |
| `alwaysThinkingEnabled` | <Documented /> | boolean | - | Turn extended thinking off for every session. | Any settings file |
| `availableModels` | <Documented /> | array of string | - | Restrict which models people can pick. It accepts family aliases (`opus`), version prefixes (`opus-4-5`), and full model IDs. An empty array leaves only the default model. | Any settings file |
| `availableModelsMatch` | <Documented /> <ManagedOnly /> | enum: `prefix`, `exact` | - | Make each `availableModels` model ID entry permit only the version it names. `prefix` is the default. `exact` stops an entry from allowing other versions. | Managed settings only |
| `deniedModels` | <Documented /> <ManagedOnly /> | array of string | - | Block specific models, even ones `availableModels` permits. A family alias blocks the family. Claude Code does not start if no allowed model is left for Default. | Managed settings only |
| `effortLevel` | <Documented /> | enum: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` | - | Set a default effort level for models without a saved level of their own. Claude Code saves levels for supported models. | Any settings file |
| `enforceAvailableModels` | <Documented /> | boolean | - | Keep the `/model` Default choice inside your `availableModels` allowlist. It has no effect when `availableModels` is unset or empty. | Any settings file |
| `fallbackModel` | <Documented /> | array of string | - | Name backup models for when the primary is overloaded. Claude Code tries the models in order. The `--fallback-model` flag wins. `default` expands to the default model. | Any settings file |
| `fastMode` | <Documented /> | boolean | - | Turn fast mode on for sessions where it's available. | Any settings file |
| `fastModePerSessionOptIn` | <Documented /> | boolean | - | Require people to turn fast mode on each session. Each session starts with fast mode off. | Any settings file |
| `maxEffortLevel` | <Documented /> | string | - | Cap the effort level for every model or per model, on every provider. The lowest value across files wins. Claude Code does not clamp an effort set through `CLAUDE_CODE_EXTRA_BODY`. | Any settings file |
| `model` | <Documented /> | string | - | Change the model Claude Code starts with. | Any settings file |
| `modelOverrides` | <Documented /> | object | - | Map model IDs to your provider's IDs, such as Bedrock ARNs. Usually set in managed settings. Since `2.1.305`, `/effort` and `/autocompact` settings apply even when the model name differs from a `modelOverrides` value by letter case or a `[1m]` tag ([v2.1.305 release](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.305)). | Any settings file |
| `modelPicker` | <Documented /> | object | - | Choose which models the `/model` picker lists, in your own order and with your own labels. Claude Code reads it only from managed, `--settings`, and user settings. The first source that sets it wins whole. | User or managed settings |
| `modelPricing` | <Documented /> <ManagedOnly /> | object | - | Report spend at your organization's contracted rates instead of list price. `overrides` maps a model ID to USD rates per million tokens. The figures stay estimates. | Managed settings only |
| `modelSettings` | <Documented /> | object: model name to `{effortLevel, maxEffortLevel, autoCompactWindow}` | - | Keep a saved effort level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`), a top effort cap (`maxEffortLevel`), or an auto-compact window (`"auto"` or 100000 to 1000000 tokens) for each model. `/autocompact` saves here. Claude Code drops invalid values. Across settings files the lowest cap wins. Source: the program. | Any settings file |
| `promptCacheTtl` | <Documented /> | string | - | Choose the prompt cache lifetime for the main conversation. The values are `5m` or `1h`. When unset, it is 1 hour on a subscription and 5 minutes on an API key or cloud provider. `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` wins. | Any settings file |
| `showThinkingSummaries` | <Documented /> | boolean | - | See summaries of Claude's thinking instead of a collapsed stub. | Any settings file |
| `subagentPromptCacheTtl` | <Documented /> | string | - | Choose the prompt cache lifetime for subagent requests. The values are `5m` or `1h`. When unset, it is 5 minutes unless `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1`. `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` wins. | Any settings file |
| `switchModelsOnFlag` | <Documented /> | boolean | - | Switch models automatically or pause when a safety classifier flags a request. | Any settings file |
| `totalTokensReminder` | <Undocumented /> | enum: `off`, `infinite`, `fixed`, `countdown`, `padded-countdown` | `padded-countdown`, else `off` | Add a "tokens left" reminder to the system prompt and after each tool result. Modes: `off`, `infinite`, `fixed`, `countdown`, `padded-countdown`. The default is `padded-countdown` for a model that carries the `total_tokens_reminder` capability, and `off` for one that does not. Sonnet 5.5 and Opus 5.5 lost that capability in `2.1.314`. `CLAUDE_CODE_TOTAL_TOKENS_REMINDER` wins. | Settings files |
| `totalTokensReminderAfterUserTurn` | <Undocumented /> | boolean | On | Repeat the "tokens left" reminder after each user prompt. When off, it shows only in the system prompt and after tool results. `CLAUDE_CODE_TOTAL_TOKENS_REMINDER_AFTER_USER_TURN` wins. | Settings files |
| `totalTokensReminderBudget` | <Undocumented /> | integer | `15000000` | Set the starting token budget of `padded-countdown`. `CLAUDE_CODE_TOTAL_TOKENS_REMINDER_BUDGET` wins. | Settings files |

## Example

### Opus at High Effort with a Fallback

This file starts each session on Opus at high effort. If Opus is overloaded, Claude Code tries Sonnet. The main conversation keeps its prompt cache for one hour.

```json title="~/.claude/settings.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://clawdipedia.cc/schemas/claude-code-settings.json",
  "model": "opus",
  "effortLevel": "high",
  "fallbackModel": ["sonnet"],
  "promptCacheTtl": "1h"
}
```
