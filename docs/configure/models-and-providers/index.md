Claude Code has a built-in list of 22 models.
It also knows the model names of each cloud provider, and a set of short aliases such as `opus`.
You choose a model with a flag, an environment variable, a setting, or the `/model` command.
For example, run `claude --model opus`. Or set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL`, or the `model` and `modelOverrides` settings.
Pick a provider with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` and its siblings. Limit choices with `availableModels`.
Settings live in `~/.claude/settings.json` (user), `.claude/settings.json` (project), managed settings, and your shell environment.
The pages below list every model, alias, and provider switch. To see how Claude Code makes the choice at run time, read [Models](../../how-it-works/models.md).

## Example

Pin Opus and Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock. Then start Claude Code on a 1M window of Opus.

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8'
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0'
claude --model opus[1m] --effort high
```

Limit what users can pick in managed settings:

```json title="managed-settings.json"
{
  "availableModels": ["sonnet", "claude-opus-4-8"],
  "modelOverrides": {
    "claude-opus-4-8": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:123456789012:application-inference-profile/opus-prod"
  }
}
```
