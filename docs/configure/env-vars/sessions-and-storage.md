title: Sessions and Storage
description: Environment variables for config folders, session files, resume, install, and updates.
sidebar_position: 9
---

These variables decide where Claude Code keeps its files and how it handles saved sessions.
They also control installs and auto updates.
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is the most used one. It moves the whole `.claude` folder.

This page lists 79 variables. Use absolute paths. Set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` to stop updates. Project and local settings cannot set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Set these in your shell.

## Example

```bash
export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-work"
claude
```

This session uses a separate config folder, so you can keep a work and a personal setup apart.

## Variables

The rows are in name order. See [Environment Variables](index.md#how-to-read-the-tables) for what each column and badge means.

| Variable | Status | What it does | Values and default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BUN_INSTALL` | <Undocumented /> | Names the Bun install folder. Claude Code uses it to detect a Bun global install and pick `bun` or `npm` as the package manager for update and install-prefix commands. | Text. Checked against `<value>/install/global/` in the executable path | Auto-update and install detection |
| `CLAUDE_AFTER_LAST_COMPACT` | <Undocumented /> | Asks the session logs API for only the lines after the last compaction. | On or off. A truthy value adds the query parameter `after_last_compact=true` to the session logs fetch | Remote session log fetch. Not set from project `env` before trust |
| `CLAUDE_BG_TCC_DISCLAIMED` | <Undocumented /> | Marks that a macOS process already re-executed with disclaimed responsibility. This avoids a second re-exec. | Text. Claude Code sets it to `1` before `execve`. The new process reads it, then deletes it | MacOS background sessions. Not set from project `env` before trust |
| `CLAUDE_BG_WORKSPACE_TRUSTED` | <Undocumented /> | Tells a background session that the workspace was already trusted. Project settings env and hooks then stay on. | On or off. The dispatcher sets `1`. The session also checks the stored trust record | Background sessions. Not set from project `env` before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTOUPDATER_DISABLED_BY_HOST` | <Undocumented /> | Tells Claude Code that the host manages updates. Plugin autoupdate then turns off when the host pin says so. | On or off | Host-embedded sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF` | <Undocumented /> | Sets the git base ref that Claude Code uses in `merge-base` calls for diffs. Claude Code rejects a ref that starts with `-`. | Text. A per-checkout ref from `CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REFS` wins | Cloud and repo checkout sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REFS` | <Undocumented /> | Gives a base ref for each repo checkout. It feeds the same `merge-base` diff logic as `CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_REF`. | Text | Cloud and repo checkout sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_CCR_SKIP_FRESH_MIGRATIONS` | <Undocumented /> | Skips the config migrations on a fresh config. It marks them as done. | On or off. Applies only when two further checks about a fresh cloud config pass | Cloud sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` | <Documented /> | Marks a session that Claude Code started as a subprocess. Claude Code sets it. | On or off. A nested interactive session skips `--resume` lists. `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE` overrides that | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG_WATCH_EVENTS` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="Works only behind a feature flag or server gate" /> | Makes the config freshness watcher use file system events instead of interval polling. | On or off, off by default. It takes effect only on Linux. Background sessions unset it | Linux only |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADMIN_ENV_UNION` | <Documented /> | Uses only the top admin source `env` block instead of merging `env` per key across admin sources. | On or off. Must be in the environment at start | Managed settings |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AWAITING_USER_IDLE` | <Undocumented /> | Turns off the idle accounting that parks session activity while Claude waits for the user. | On or off, off by default | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FILE_CHECKPOINTING` | <Documented /> | Turns off file checkpointing, so `/rewind` cannot restore code. Overrides `fileCheckpointingEnabled`. | On or off. SDK sessions also need `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_SDK_FILE_CHECKPOINTING` | All sessions. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_HOME_SETTINGS_SEED` | <Undocumented /> | Stops the home settings seed from starting in the file sync worker. The start check reports `disabled`. | On or off, off by default. Claude Code reads a truthy string from the child spawn environment | Remote and hosted sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NESTED_CHAIN_IDLE` | <Undocumented /> | Stops the session activity tracker from counting nested prompts that block on the user. | On or off, off by default | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NESTED_USER_REPAIR` | <Undocumented /> | Turns off the repair of a user message that arrives wrapped one level deep on the input stream. The log then says `repair_disabled`. | On or off, off by default | SDK and stream input |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_STARTUP_WORK_GATE` | <Undocumented /> | Skips arming the startup work gate that makes queued startup tasks wait. | On or off, off by default | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DOWNLOAD_DEADLINE_MS_FOR_TESTING` | <Undocumented /> | Overrides the total download deadline of the updater download, for tests. | A number. Invalid or `0` gives the default | Native installer and updater download |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EAGER_FLUSH` | <Undocumented /> | Flushes the transcript to storage right after each persist, before the turn goes on. | On or off, off by default. Also on when `CLAUDE_CODE_IS_COWORK` has a value | SDK and print mode with session persistence |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_SDK_FILE_CHECKPOINTING` | <Documented /> | Turns on file checkpointing in non-interactive mode. | On or off, off by default. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FILE_CHECKPOINTING` still wins. The SDK sets it to `true` when its option is on | SDK and `--print` mode |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXIT_AFTER_STOP_DELAY` | <Documented /> | Exits the process this many ms after the query loop goes idle. | A number, off by default. Whole number. A value above `0` turns it on | SDK mode and scripts |

| `CLAUDE_CODE_HOME_SEED_VERDICT_TIMEOUT_MS` | <Undocumented /> | Lowers the longest wait for the verdict of the home seed step. The value cannot raise the built-in maximum. | A number of milliseconds. A whole number, with a minimum of `0`. The result is the smaller of this value and a built-in cap | Host-seeded home or settings sync |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SESSION_ID` | <Undocumented /> | Records the session id that the host app gave in the session registry entry as `hostSessionId`. | Text. Read only for host-started sessions | Host apps (desktop) |

| `CLAUDE_CODE_HOVER_REST` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="Works only behind a feature flag or server gate" /> | Pins the storage backend and the config home at start. Claude Code then reports a later change of `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. | On, off, or unset, off if unset. Any truthy string also triggers the pin at CLI entry. Unset falls back to a feature flag | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MANAGED_SETTINGS_PATH` | <Undocumented /> | Names the folder of managed (policy) settings in place of the machine default. This build ignores it. We set it to a folder with `managed-settings.json`. The debug log still read the machine default folder. | Text. Claude Code also sets it to a config dir in the env it builds for isolated runs | All sessions, managed settings |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET` | <Documented /> | Gives the path of the session inbox socket to hooks and Bash commands. | Set by Claude Code when it binds the socket | Sessions with cross-session messaging |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN` | <Documented /> | Gives a per-session token that a script can send to the inbox socket to prove it belongs to the session. | Text (a secret). Set by Claude Code beside the socket path. Claude Code deletes it when the socket closes | Sessions with cross-session messaging |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER_AUTO_UPDATE` | <Documented /> | Lets Claude Code run the package manager upgrade command in the background. Matches the docs for Homebrew and WinGet. | On or off.

| `CLAUDE_CODE_PROJECT_DIR_NAME` | <Documented /> | Sets the `projects/` subdir name for transcripts and memory. Needs `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. | Text. Claude Code refuses Windows reserved names | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RELAUNCH_HOME_TRUST` | <Undocumented /> | Carries a `pid:starttime` token across a relaunch. It proves that the home dir trust came from the parent process. | Text. Claude Code sets it on relaunch | Relaunched sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RELAUNCH_PROACTIVITY_BASELINE` | <Undocumented /> | Carries the proactivity baseline permission mode across a relaunch.

| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESTRICT_PERSONAL_CONFIG` | <Undocumented /> | Restricts use of personal Claude Code files, per a bundle message. The check also reads a settings-level source. | On or off. Part of the env list that background sessions pass on | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_FROM_SESSION` | <Undocumented /> | Names a source session to load at start with the sessions API. It applies when a URL or SDK URL start has no messages. | Text. Claude Code clears it for child worker processes | Remote and SDK starts |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_INTERRUPTED_TURN` | <Documented /> | Resumes a turn that ended in the middle. | On or off. Claude Code sets it to `1` when it restarts a worker or background session a second time | SDK and background sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_INTERRUPTED_TURN_MAX_AGE_MS` | <Documented /> | Bounds the age of the last message for auto resume of a turn. | A number of milliseconds. `0` or unset gives no bound. Negative or non-numeric gives 3600000 ms | SDK and background sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_PROMPT` | <Documented /> | Overrides the continuation text that Claude Code sends to the model when an interrupted turn resumes instead of resending its prompt. | Text, `Continue from where you left off.` by default. Empty string uses the default. The background supervisor sets it on respawn after a first attempt | Resume, background sessions, `-p`. Not set from project `env` before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_REASON` | <Undocumented /> | Names why a host resumed an interrupted turn. The first reply frames of the resumed turn carry the value. | Text. Other values fall back to `interrupted_turn` | Hosts and SDK output. Docs of the SDK frame list examples such as `host_draining` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_SESSIONSTART_HOOKS_WAIT_MS` | <Undocumented /> | On resume, waits up to this many ms for `SessionStart` hooks, then continues without them. A Probes run saw no effect. | A number of milliseconds. Integer 1 to 2147483647, unset by default. When unset, resume does not wait for these hooks | Resume of a session that has messages |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_SOURCE_ALIVE` | <Undocumented /> | Tells a resumed or forked session that its source session is still alive. It carries ids and a boundary time used to skip rows already seen. | Text. Fields seen are `sessionId`, `parentSessionId`, and `boundaryAt` | Resume and fork. A host sets it. Not set from project `env` before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="Works only behind a feature flag or server gate" /> | Sets the idle age in minutes after which a resumed session receives the return prompt. Default is 70. | A number, `70` by default. Integer, default `70`. Works only when a feature flag or a feature flag is on | Interactive resume. Gated by a feature flag and a feature flag |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="Works only behind a feature flag or server gate" /> | Sets the estimated token size above which a resumed session receives the return prompt. Default is 100000. | A number, `100000` by default. Integer, default `100000`. Works only when a feature flag or a feature flag is on | Interactive resume. Gated by a feature flag and a feature flag |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_TOLERATES_CONTEXT_APPENDS` | <Undocumented /> | On resume, does not treat trailing context-only user rows from the host as a new prompt. This keeps interrupted-turn detection correct. | On or off. Claude Code also passes it to the parked-permission logic as `toleratesContextAppends` | Resume and SDK or remote hosts |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_TOLERATES_CONTEXT_SEEDS` | <Undocumented /> | On resume, lets context seed rows and queued task notifications pass in interrupted-turn detection. Then the log reads as no turn rows. | On or off | Resume and SDK or remote hosts |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_BEGAN_AS_COPY` | <Undocumented /> | The value `1` marks a session that began as a copy of another. Then `--resume` in print mode does not continue the last turn of the session it was copied from, and does not run a tool call that a hook deferred there. Another value is ignored. The hidden flag `--session-began-as-copy` means the same, and either one is enough (the program). | Only `1` has an effect | Print mode `--resume` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` | <Documented /> | Holds the current session ID for Bash, hook, and stdio MCP subprocesses. Session sync also reads it. | Text. Claude Code sets it for subprocesses. Claude Code deletes it from some inherited envs so a child does not reuse it. For stdio MCP servers the ID stays as it was at spawn | Bash, PowerShell, hooks, MCP stdio. Claude Code sets it |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_KIND` | <Undocumented /> | Names the kind of session. The value `bg` marks a background session, which changes cwd handling and restart advice. | Text. The code seen tests only the value `bg` | Background sessions. The supervisor sets it |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_NAME` | <Undocumented /> | Sets the session name in the concurrent-session record. A user-set name has source `user`. | Text. The code trims it. An empty result means no name | Concurrent-session registry, background sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_START_ANNOUNCEMENTS_BEFORE_PROMPT` | <Undocumented /> | Changes the order of session start announcements relative to the first prompt. When set, they come before it. | On or off. The exact order effect was not read further | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY` | <Documented /> | Skips writing prompt history and session transcripts to disk. Such sessions do not show in resume or up-arrow history. | On or off. Persistence reports the reason `skip_prompt_history`. It also marks a nested ambient session | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS_FOR_TESTING` | <Undocumented /> | Overrides the no-data stall timeout of the update download. Meant for tests. | A number. A zero or invalid value falls back to `120000` ms | Installer and updater downloads |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_STARTUP_FAILURE_RESULTS` | <Documented /> | Makes a `stream-json` run write a result message with a `startup_failure_reason` for startup failures that end with stderr alone. | On or off | Print mode with `--output-format stream-json` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` | <Documented /> | Overrides the temp directory for internal temp files. Claude Code also passes it to child shells and uses it as `TMPDIR` in the sandbox. | Text. Falls back to `/tmp`. The sandbox also reads undocumented `CLAUDE_TMPDIR` and uses `/tmp/claude` last | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_TRANSCRIPT_LOCAL_GC` | <Documented /> <Differs note="The official docs and the program disagree. The row says how." /> | Trims the transcript before each compaction once the file passes 5 MB. The docs match this. The docs omit that `0` also blocks a flag-driven path. | On, off, or unset. For the remote path it overrides a feature flag. The local path needs non-interactive and not `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` | `-p` and SDK sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_TRANSCRIPT_SLIM_TOOL_RESULTS` | <Undocumented /> | Picks `slim` over `counted` mode for tool results in the transcript of SDK sessions that use an SDK URL. | On or off. Read at startup in non-interactive sessions with an SDK URL | SDK URL sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | <Documented /> | Sets the config directory in place of `~/.claude`. It also changes the name of the secure storage entry with a hash of the path. | Text | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_IMPORT_CONVERSATIONS` | <Undocumented /> | Enables the import-conversations command. Without it the command says it is not enabled. | On or off. The command also needs `--cwd` | CLI import command |
| `CLAUDE_JOB_DIR` | <Documented /> | Holds the job directory of a background session. Claude Code writes `exit-cause` and `exit-detail` files there. | A path. Claude Code sets it | Background sessions |
| `CLAUDE_RELAUNCH_SESSION_ADD_DIRS` | <Undocumented /> | Carries the session `--add-dir` paths over a relaunch of Claude Code. | - | - |
| `CLAUDE_TMPDIR` | <Undocumented /> | Sets the temp directory for the Bash sandbox, after `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR`. | - | - |
| `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` | <Documented /> | Turns off automatic background updates. | On or off | - |
| `DISABLE_INSTALLATION_CHECKS` | <Documented /> | Turns off installation warnings. | On or off | - |
| `DISABLE_UPDATES` | <Documented /> | Blocks every update, including `claude update` and `claude install`, with the message "Updates are disabled by your administrator". | On or off. Claude Code also reports it as the reason the auto-updater is off, ahead of `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` | All sessions. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `TEMP` | <Documented /> | Names the temp directory. Claude Code uses it to find the temp dir when `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` is not set. | Text. Non-empty string. On Windows, Claude Code tries `TEMP`, then `TMP` | All sessions |
| `TERMUX_VERSION` | <Undocumented /> | Marks the Termux app on Android. Claude Code then uses `$PREFIX/tmp` instead of `/tmp` for sockets and daemon files. | Text. Non-empty string, with `PREFIX` set. Claude Code uses it for the daemon dir, the socks dir, and a path check | Termux on Android |
| `TMP` | <Documented /> | Names the temp directory. Claude Code uses it as a fallback when `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` and `TMPDIR` are not set. | Text. Non-empty string. On Windows, Claude Code tries `TEMP` then `TMP` | All sessions |
| `TMPDIR` | <Documented /> | Names the temp directory. Claude Code uses it as the temp root on Linux when `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` is not set. | Text. Non-empty string. macOS ignores it for the temp root. Claude Code also adds it to the allowed write paths | All sessions |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | <Documented /> | Names the XDG cache directory. Claude Code uses it for cache paths and adds it to allowed sandbox paths. | Text. Non-empty string. Default is `~/.cache` | Linux |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | <Documented /> | Names the XDG config directory. Claude Code uses it for the global git ignore file and the Anthropic config dir. | A path. Non-empty absolute path. Default is `~/.config` | Linux and macOS |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | <Documented /> | Names the XDG data directory. Claude Code uses it to find shell history and adds it to allowed sandbox paths. | Text. Non-empty string. Default is `~/.local/share` | Linux |
| `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | <Undocumented /> | Names the XDG runtime directory. Claude Code puts the `cc-socks` socket dir under it. | Text, dir by default. Non-empty string. Falls back to a default dir if unset or if the path is too long for a socket | Linux |
| `XDG_STATE_HOME` | <Documented /> | Names the XDG state directory. Claude Code uses it for log and state paths and adds it to allowed sandbox paths. | Text. Non-empty string. Default is `~/.local/state` | Linux |

## How It Works

Claude Code writes settings, transcripts, and caches under the config folder.
Settings files copy `env` values as written. No shell expands them, so `~` and `$HOME` stay as typed. Use an absolute path in `settings.json`.
