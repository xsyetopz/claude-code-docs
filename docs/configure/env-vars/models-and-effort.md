title: Models and Effort
description: Environment variables that pick the model, pin model aliases, set thinking effort, and limit output size.
sidebar_position: 2
---

These variables choose which model Claude Code uses and how hard it thinks.
They also pin what the aliases `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, and `fable` mean, add your own entry to the `/model` picker, and limit output size.
Use them when you want the same model in every session or when a gateway needs custom model IDs.

This page lists 84 variables. A `--model` flag or `/model` overrides `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` overrides `--effort` and `/effort`.

## Example

```json title="~/.claude/settings.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://xsyetopz.github.io/claude-code-docs/schemas/claude-code-settings.json",
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "opus",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL": "high"
  }
}
```

Every new session starts on the `opus` alias with high effort.

## Variables

The table is sorted by name. See [Environment Variables](index.md#how-to-read-the-tables) for what each column and badge means.

| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_LEGACY_MODEL_REMAP` | <Documented /> | Stops the remap of Opus 4 and Opus 4.1 ids to the current Opus. | On or off. The remap list holds `claude-opus-4-20250514`, `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`, `claude-opus-4-0` and `claude-opus-4-1` | Anthropic API. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_MODEL_ACCESS_FALLBACK` | <Documented /> | Stops the switch to an older model when the account loses access to the session model. | On or off. `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_MODEL_FALLBACK` does the same | Bedrock and Vertex per docs |

This variable overrides it" /> <Experimental /> | Forces the server-side advisor tool on, and lets a base model with no advisor rank use it. | On or off, off by default. Still blocked by `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADVISOR_TOOL` and by provider checks | First-party and eligible providers |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY` | <Documented /> | Fills the `/model` picker from the gateway `/v1/models` endpoint. | On or off, off by default. Needs the `firstParty` provider and a non-Anthropic `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. The `gateway` provider also checks it at bootstrap | Gateway setups |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_MID_CONVERSATION_SYSTEM` | <Undocumented /> | Forces mid-conversation system messages on for every model. | On or off, off by default. Skips the model checks and the flags for system turns | API requests |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | <Documented /> | Sets the maximum output tokens for most requests, clamped to the model cap. | A number. The default depends on the model. Claude Code lowers a value above the model cap to the cap | All sessions. Project `env` can set it before trust |

| `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL_CAPABILITIES` | <Undocumented /> | Overrides model capabilities. Syntax is `pattern=cap1,-cap2` entries split on a semicolon, and a leading `-` turns a capability off. | Text. A pattern ending in `*` matches by prefix. An entry with no `=` applies to all models | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL_CATALOG` | <Undocumented /> | Turns off the served model catalog when set to a false value. Since `2.1.311`, a false value also stops Claude Code from loading model settings from a signed file on `downloads.claude.ai` on Bedrock, Mantle, Vertex, and Foundry. | Text. A false value is `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`. A project's settings can only set it to a false value. The served catalog is also off for bare mode, essential-traffic-only, a unix socket, non-first-party, or policy | First-party logins. Bedrock, Mantle, Vertex, and Foundry for the signed file |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL_CATALOG_URL` | <Undocumented /> | Sets a custom URL for the published model catalog. A `file` URL is treated as a local file. | Text. Used when the managed config has no `url`. A bad URL turns the published path off | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_MODEL_FALLBACK` | <Undocumented /> | Forbids model substitution. A fallback attempt then fails with a message that names this variable. | On or off. Works like `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_MODEL_ACCESS_FALLBACK` for the availability chain | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` | <Documented /> | Sets the prompt cache TTL of the main conversation. | `enum` of `5m` or `1h`. `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M` wins over it | Main thread. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_REFUSAL_FALLBACK_CATCH_ALL` | <Undocumented /> | Lets a refusal retry on the fallback model even when its category has no fallback map entry. | On, off, or unset, comes by default. A false value turns it off | Sessions with a fallback model |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_RUSTLING_PIXEL` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="Works only behind a feature flag or server gate" /> | Picks how Claude Code keeps thinking blocks that came from another model. Values are `all`, `upgrade`, or `none`. | Text, `all` by default. An invalid value logs a warning and uses `upgrade`. When unset, a server setting or the flag default `all` decides | Model calls that carry foreign thinking blocks. Needs an eligible account or provider |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | <Documented /> <Gated note="A feature flag or server gate decides by default. This variable overrides it" /> | Chooses the full or the shorter system prompt. `1` forces the short one. `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` force the full one. | Unset lets the model, a feature flag, and a server config decide | All models. Docs list per-model defaults |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_FAST_MODE_NETWORK_ERRORS` | <Documented /> | Treats a failed fast mode availability check as available. A response of "disabled by your organization" still counts. | On or off. It applies only to network-type failure reasons | Fast mode on the first-party API |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_FAST_MODE_ORG_CHECK` | <Documented /> | Skips the client-side fast mode availability check, for proxies that intercept the check instead of refusing it. | On or off. It has no effect in one account mode where the check always runs. The API still rejects requests if the org turns fast mode off | Fast mode on the first-party API |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SNAPPY_PELICAN` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="A feature flag or server gate decides by default. This variable overrides it" /> | Forces a feature flag behavior on or off. When it is off, relative `effort` values `lower` and `higher` are dropped from the input. | On, off, or unset. It is ignored when the subagent model is forced or not set to inherit | Subagent calls. gated by a feature flag |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` | <Documented /> | Sets the default model for subagents, teammates, and workflow agents with no model set another way. | Text. The values `inherit` and unset mean the parent model. Docs match | Subagents. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE` | <Documented /> | Forces one model onto all subagents, teammates, and workflow agents. The `model` parameter is then ignored. | On or off. The coordinator prompt also reads it | Subagents, teammates, workflows |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` | <Documented /> | Sets the prompt cache TTL to `5m` or `1h` for requests outside the main conversation. | One of a fixed set of values. Enum `5m` or `1h`. It beats the `subagentPromptCacheTtl` setting | Subagents, workflows, background work. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_THISTLE_GREBE` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="A feature flag or server gate decides by default. This variable overrides it" /> | Picks a prompt steer variant. Env wins over client data, then flag, then a per-model default. | Text. Accepts `default`, `no_nudges`, or `counter_steer`. Other values are ignored | All providers |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_TURN_UPDATES` | <Undocumented /> | Forces the `turn_updates` system prompt section on or off. It asks the model to restate key mid-turn findings in its final message. | On, off, or unset. Without it, the prompt logic decides | All sessions |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_WILLOW_TERN` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="A feature flag or server gate decides by default. This variable overrides it" /> | Forces a `willow_tern` prompt switch on. The code names it a writing override. Otherwise client data, the model, or a flag decides. | On or off. Only `true` forces it. A non-boolean client data value is ignored | Model-dependent |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOW_SUBAGENT_MODEL` | <Undocumented /> | Sets the model for workflow subagents. The value `inherit` means no override. A probe showed the order: this variable, then `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`, then the main model. It also wins over a `model` option in `agent()` ([Probes](../../reference/probes.md#subagents-and-hooks)). | Text. Ignored when `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE` is on and the value came from project settings. Allowed in project `env` | Workflows |
| `CLAUDE_EFFORT` | <Documented /> | Holds the effort level of the session for Bash subprocesses and hook commands. | Set by Claude Code when the model supports effort. Also the skill token `${CLAUDE_EFFORT}` | Bash tool and hooks |

| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_OPUS` | <Documented /> | Turns off prompt caching when the request model is the default Opus model. | On or off, Opus by default. Compared with the default Opus model id on each request | All sessions. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_SONNET` | <Documented /> | Turns off prompt caching when the request model is the default Sonnet model. | On or off, Sonnet by default. Compared with the default Sonnet model id on each request | All sessions. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` | <Documented /> | Asks for the 1-hour prompt cache TTL in place of 5 minutes. | On or off. Lower priority than `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M`, the TTL env vars, settings, and agent frontmatter | All sessions. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H_BEDROCK` | <Documented /> <Deprecated note="Alias of ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H" /> | Deprecated alias of `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` for Bedrock. It still asks for the 1-hour TTL. | On or off. Works only when the provider is `bedrock` | Bedrock. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `FALLBACK_FOR_ALL_PRIMARY_MODELS` | <Documented /> | Stops retrying after repeated overload errors for every model when no fallback model is set. | Text. Any non-empty string counts, so `0` still enables it | API requests. Project `env` can set it before trust |
| `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M` | <Documented /> | Forces the 5-minute prompt cache TTL. | On or off. Checked first, ahead of the TTL env vars and `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` | All sessions. Project `env` can set it before trust |

| `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` | <Documented /> | Sets a fixed extended-thinking token budget. `0` turns thinking off. | A number | - |

## How It Works

Claude Code picks the model in a fixed order: the `--model` flag or `/model` first, then `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, then the `model` setting, then `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL`.
The `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` variables change what an alias points to.
They matter most on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, or a gateway, where model IDs differ.
The `_NAME`, `_DESCRIPTION`, and `_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` variants only change how the model shows in the picker and which features Claude Code allows for it.
