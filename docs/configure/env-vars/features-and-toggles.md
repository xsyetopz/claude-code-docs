title: Features and Toggles
description: Environment variables that turn single features on or off, including server-gated features.
sidebar_position: 13
---

These variables flip one feature each.
Some turn off a feature that is on by default. Others force on a feature that a server flag controls.
A row with the Gated badge only works when a feature flag or server gate allows it, unless the variable overrides the gate.

This page lists 66 variables. Most take `1` to turn on and `0` to turn off.

## Example

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE=1
claude
```

Claude Code starts in its minimal mode. This is the same mode that the `--bare` flag turns on.

## Variables

The table is sorted by name. The Gated badge tells you a flag or gate is involved. See [Environment Variables](index.md#how-to-read-the-tables) for the columns.

| Variable | Status | What it does | Values and default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_AGENT` | <Undocumented /> | Carries an agent id for child tools. Claude Code fills it when it is unset or starts with `claude-code_` or `claude-code/`. | On or off | All sessions. Not set from project `env` before trust |
| `BUN_CHROME_PATH` | <Undocumented /> <Gated note="Works only behind a feature flag or server gate" /> | Sets the Chrome binary for the artifact preview browser.

## How It Works

Claude Code asks a server for feature flags at startup. A flag turns a feature on or off for an account.
Some variables override a flag. Others only work when the flag is already on.
Turning telemetry off also stops flag fetching, which turns off the features that need it.
