These variables point Claude Code at a cloud provider instead of the Anthropic API.
You switch a provider on with a `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*` variable, then set the region, credentials, and endpoints for it.
They also cover LLM gateways that sit in front of a provider.

This page lists 78 variables. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, or the Foundry switch to `1`, then set region, project, and endpoint variables. To turn one off, unset the `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*` variable. A stale shell export can be overridden with an empty string in `settings.json` `env`.

## Example

```json title="~/.claude/settings.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://xsyetopz.github.io/claude-code-docs/schemas/claude-code-settings.json",
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK": "1",
    "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

Claude Code now talks to Amazon Bedrock in `us-east-1`.

## Variables

The table is sorted by name. See [Environment Variables](index.md#how-to-read-the-tables) for what each column and badge means.

| Variable | Status | What it does | Values and default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_AWS_BASE_URL` | <Documented /> | Overrides the Claude Platform on AWS endpoint URL. | Text. A set value also changes first-party checks for this provider | Provider `anthropicAws`. Not set from project `env` before trust |
| `ANTHROPIC_AWS_WORKSPACE_ID` | <Documented /> | Workspace ID for Claude Platform on AWS. Claude Code shows it as `Workspace ID` and passes `workspaceId` to the AWS client. | Text, headers by default.

## How It Works

Claude Code picks one provider when it starts.
The provider decides which auth path, endpoint, and model IDs it uses.
If a shell profile exports a provider switch you cannot remove, set it to an empty string in the `env` block.
Claude Code treats an empty value as unset for provider selection.
