An environment variable is a named setting that a program reads when it starts.
Claude Code `2.1.303` reads well over a thousand of them.
This section lists 1399 that you can use, split into groups so you can find them.
A few are in the official docs. Most are found only in the program.

## At a Glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Can you use it? | Yes. Set a variable in your shell, or under `env` in a `settings.json` file. |
| Can you change it? | Yes. Change the value, then restart `claude`. Values in a settings `env` block also apply to a running session when the file changes. |
| Can you turn it on or off? | Delete the variable. In a settings file you cannot remove one that your shell sets, but you can set it to an empty string. |
| Where does it live? | Your shell, or the `env` key of `~/.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, or managed settings. |

## How Claude Code Reads Variables

Claude Code starts with the environment it inherits from your shell.
It then reads the `env` key of every settings file and writes each entry into its own process environment.
Source: the official [Environment Variables](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars) page.

### Which Value Wins

1. A value in a settings `env` block replaces the value from your shell in most sessions. The official docs list the sessions that keep the shell value.
2. Between settings files, `env` values follow the normal settings order. A managed entry beats the same variable in user or project settings.
3. Some behaviors have a variable, a settings key, and a flag. Which one wins differs for each pair. For example, `--model` and `/model` beat `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` beats the `model` key. But `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` beats `--effort` and `/effort`.
4. Project and local settings cannot set some variables, such as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and the OpenTelemetry exporter variables. Most other `env` values from a project wait until you trust the folder.
5. You cannot remove a variable from a settings file. To cancel one that a shell profile exports, set it to an empty string, for example `"CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX": ""`. Claude Code treats the empty value as unset for provider selection, but child processes still inherit the empty value.

Each row says what applies to it. Look in the Notes column for the words "Project `env` can set it before trust" or "Not set from project `env` before trust".

## Set Variables in `settings.json`

Put variables under the `env` key. Claude Code copies the values as written. No shell expands them, so `~` and `$HOME` stay as typed. Use absolute paths.

```json title="~/.claude/settings.json"
{
  "env": {
    "API_TIMEOUT_MS": "1200000",
    "BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS": "300000",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL": "high"
  }
}
```

Or set one in your shell for one session.

```bash
export API_TIMEOUT_MS=1200000
claude
```

Removing a variable from the file does not unset it in a running session. The removal applies the next time you start `claude`.
Features that read their variables only once at startup, such as OpenTelemetry, keep their startup values until you restart.

Numeric variables, such as timeouts and token budgets, accept forms like `2e3` (2000) and `64_000` (64000) as well as plain digits. A few rows say they take plain digits only.

## Twenty Useful Variables

| Variable | Page | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [Auth and Accounts](auth-and-accounts.md) | Your API key. |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | [Network and Proxy](network-and-proxy.md) | Send API calls to another address. |

| `NO_PROXY` | [Network and Proxy](network-and-proxy.md) | Hosts that skip the proxy. |
| `API_TIMEOUT_MS` | [Network and Proxy](network-and-proxy.md) | How long an API request may take. Default is 600000. |
| `BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` | [Tools and Bash](tools-and-bash.md) | Default time limit of a foreground shell command. |
| `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` | [Tools and Bash](tools-and-bash.md) | How many characters of shell output Claude reads back. |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | [Context and Compaction](context-and-compaction.md) | Start compaction earlier. |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | [Sessions and Storage](sessions-and-storage.md) | Use another folder instead of `~/.claude`. |
| `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` | [Sessions and Storage](sessions-and-storage.md) | Stop automatic background updates. |
| `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | [Telemetry and Debug](telemetry-and-debug.md) | Opt out of telemetry. Any non-empty value counts. |

## How to Read the Tables

Every group page has the same columns.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Variable | The exact name. Names are case sensitive. |
| Status | Badges. <Documented /> means the official docs name it. <Undocumented /> means only the program shows it. <Differs /> means the docs and the program disagree. <Gated /> means a feature flag or server gate is involved. |
| What it does | The effect, in plain words. |
| Values and default | The accepted values and the default, as far as the program shows. A dash means the source gave no detail. |
| Notes | Where it applies, and whether a project `env` block can set it before you trust the folder. |

:::warning
Treat <Undocumented /> and <Gated /> rows with care.
They work in `2.1.303`, but nothing promises they will work in the next release.
:::

Some rows mention a probe. That means a run of the real binary against a local stub showed what the variable changed in the request. No model call leaves the machine in a probe. A run with no visible effect does not prove that a variable does nothing.

## What Is Left Out

The tables list only variables you can use. They leave out removed or inert names, test-only names, names for Anthropic staff, and flags whose purpose nobody knows.
For every item that only the program shows, see [Undocumented Items](../../reference/undocumented.md).
