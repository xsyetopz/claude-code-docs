title: Plugins and MCP
description: Environment variables for plugins, MCP servers, skills, hooks, and marketplaces.
sidebar_position: 11
---

These variables change how Claude Code loads plugins, runs MCP servers, finds skills, and runs hooks.
They set time limits, token limits, cache paths, and marketplace behavior.
Use them to tune slow MCP servers or to lock down plugin loading.

This page lists 93 variables. `MCP_TIMEOUT` and `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` are common. Switch rows take `1`.

## Example

```json title="~/.claude/settings.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://xsyetopz.github.io/claude-code-docs/schemas/claude-code-settings.json",
  "env": {
    "MCP_TIMEOUT": "30000",
    "MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT": "120000"
  }
}
```

A server gets 30 seconds to start, and a tool call gets two minutes.

## Variables

The table is sorted by name. See [Environment Variables](index.md#how-to-read-the-tables) for what each column and badge means.

| `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_REUSE_WITHIN_MS` | <Undocumented /> | Sets a window in ms in which the plugin and skills sync can skip a round. The program keeps a stamp file `.last-complete-round` that holds a token and the list of sync kinds it covers; a round writes it, and a startup sync reuses the last round when the file is younger than this window. | A number of milliseconds. Integer 0 to 86400000. A value of 0 or less turns reuse off | Plugin and skills sync |

## How It Works

Plugins and MCP servers start when a session starts, so these variables are read early.
Some variables are passed to MCP server and hook processes. Claude Code can strip credentials first when `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB` is on.
